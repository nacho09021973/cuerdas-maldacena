All particles are excitations of some ﬁeld. These\nparticles are pointlike and they interact locally with other particles.\nEven though\nquantum ﬁeld theories describe nature at the distance scales we observe, there are\nstrong indications that new elements will be involved at very short distances (or very\nhigh energies), distances of the order of the Planck scale. The reason is that at those\ndistances (or energies) quantum gravity eﬀects become important. It has not been\npossible to quantize gravity following the usual perturbative methods. Nevertheless,\none can incorporate quantum gravity in a consistent quantum theory by giving up the\nnotion that particles are pointlike and assuming that the fundamental objects in the\ntheory are strings, namely one-dimensional extended objects [1, 2]. These strings can\noscillate, and there is a spectrum of energies, or masses, for these oscillating strings.\nThe oscillating strings look like localized, particle-like excitations to a low energy ob-\nserver. So, a single oscillating string can eﬀectively give rise to many types of particles,\ndepending on its state of oscillation. All string theories include a particle with zero\nmass and spin two. Strings can interact by splitting and joining interactions. The only\nconsistent interaction for massless spin two particles is that of gravity. Therefore, any\nstring theory will contain gravity. The structure of string theory is highly constrained.\nString theories do not make sense in an arbitrary number of dimensions or on any\narbitrary geometry. Flat space string theory exists (at least in perturbation theory)\nonly in ten dimensions. Actually, 10-dimensional string theory is described by a string\nwhich also has fermionic excitations and gives rise to a supersymmetric theory.1 String\ntheory is then a candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. One can get down to four"}

Then, low energy interactions are determined by the geometry of\nM6.\nEven though this is the motivation usually given for string theory nowadays, it is\nnot how string theory was originally discovered. String theory was discovered in an\nattempt to describe the large number of mesons and hadrons that were experimentally\ndiscovered in the 1960’s. The idea was to view all these particles as diﬀerent oscillation\nmodes of a string. The string idea described well some features of the hadron spectrum.\nFor example, the mass of the lightest hadron with a given spin obeys a relation like\nm2 ∼TJ2 + const. This is explained simply by assuming that the mass and angular\nmomentum come from a rotating, relativistic string of tension T. It was later discovered\nthat hadrons and mesons are actually made of quarks and that they are described by\nQCD.\nQCD is a gauge theory based on the group SU(3). This is sometimes stated by saying\nthat quarks have three colors. QCD is asymptotically free, meaning that the eﬀective\ncoupling constant decreases as the energy increases. At low energies QCD becomes\nstrongly coupled and it is not easy to perform calculations. One possible approach\nis to use numerical simulations on the lattice. This is at present the best available\ntool to do calculations in QCD at low energies. It was suggested by ’t Hooft that the\ntheory might simplify when the number of colors N is large [3]. The hope was that one\ncould solve exactly the theory with N = ∞, and then one could do an expansion in\n1/N = 1/3. Furthermore, as explained in the next section, the diagrammatic expansion\nof the ﬁeld theory suggests that the large N theory is a free string theory and that\nthe string coupling constant is 1/N. If the case with N = 3 is similar to the case\nwith N = ∞then this explains why the string model gave the correct relation between\nthe mass and the angular momentum. In this way the large N limit connects gauge\ntheories with string theories. The ’t Hooft argument, reviewed below, is very general,\nso it suggests that diﬀerent kinds of gauge theories will correspond to diﬀerent string\ntheories. In this review we will study this correspondence between string theories and\nthe large N limit of ﬁeld theories. We will see that the strings arising in the large N\nlimit of ﬁeld theories are the same as the strings describing quantum gravity. Namely,\nstring theory in some backgrounds, including quantum gravity, is equivalent (dual) to\na ﬁeld theory.\nWe said above that strings are not consistent in four ﬂat dimensions. Indeed, if one\nwants to quantize a four dimensional string theory an anomaly appears that forces the\nintroduction of an extra ﬁeld, sometimes called the “Liouville” ﬁeld [4]. This ﬁeld on\nthe string worldsheet may be interpreted as an extra dimension, so that the strings\neﬀectively move in ﬁve dimensions. One might qualitatively think of this new ﬁeld as\nthe “thickness” of the string. If this is the case, why do we say that the string moves"}

The reason is that, like any string theory, this theory will contain\ngravity, and the gravitational theory will live in as many dimensions as the number of\nﬁelds we have on the string. It is crucial then that the ﬁve dimensional geometry is\ncurved, so that it can correspond to a four dimensional ﬁeld theory, as described in\ndetail below.\nThe argument that gauge theories are related to string theories in the large N limit\nis very general and is valid for basically any gauge theory.\nIn particular we could\nconsider a gauge theory where the coupling does not run (as a function of the energy\nscale). Then, the theory is conformally invariant. It is quite hard to ﬁnd quantum ﬁeld\ntheories that are conformally invariant. In supersymmetric theories it is sometimes\npossible to prove exact conformal invariance. A simple example, which will be the\nmain example in this review, is the supersymmetric SU(N) (or U(N)) gauge theory in\nfour dimensions with four spinor supercharges (N = 4). Four is the maximal possible\nnumber of supercharges for a ﬁeld theory in four dimensions. Besides the gauge ﬁelds\n(gluons) this theory contains also four fermions and six scalar ﬁelds in the adjoint\nrepresentation of the gauge group.\nThe Lagrangian of such theories is completely\ndetermined by supersymmetry. There is a global SU(4) R-symmetry that rotates the\nsix scalar ﬁelds and the four fermions.\nThe conformal group in four dimensions is\nSO(4, 2), including the usual Poincar´e transformations as well as scale transformations\nand special conformal transformations (which include the inversion symmetry xµ →\nxµ/x2). These symmetries of the ﬁeld theory should be reﬂected in the dual string\ntheory. The simplest way for this to happen is if the ﬁve dimensional geometry has these\nsymmetries. Locally there is only one space with SO(4, 2) isometries: ﬁve dimensional\nAnti-de-Sitter space, or AdS5. Anti-de Sitter space is the maximally symmetric solution\nof Einstein’s equations with a negative cosmological constant. In this supersymmetric\ncase we expect the strings to also be supersymmetric. We said that superstrings move\nin ten dimensions. Now that we have added one more dimension it is not surprising any\nmore to add ﬁve more to get to a ten dimensional space. Since the gauge theory has\nan SU(4) ≃SO(6) global symmetry it is rather natural that the extra ﬁve dimensional\nspace should be a ﬁve sphere, S5. So, we conclude that N = 4 U(N) Yang-Mills theory\ncould be the same as ten dimensional superstring theory on AdS5 × S5 [5]. Here we\nhave presented a very heuristic argument for this equivalence; later we will be more\nprecise and give more evidence for this correspondence.\nThe relationship we described between gauge theories and string theory on Anti-de-\nSitter spaces was motivated by studies of D-branes and black holes in strings theory.\nD-branes are solitons in string theory [6]. They come in various dimensionalities. If\nthey have zero spatial dimensions they are like ordinary localized, particle-type soliton\nsolutions, analogous to the ’t Hooft-Polyakov [7, 8] monopole in gauge theories. These\nare called D-zero-branes. If they have one extended dimension they are called D-one-"}

They are much heavier than ordinary fundamental strings when\nthe string coupling is small. In fact, the tension of all D-branes is proportional to 1/gs,\nwhere gs is the string coupling constant. D-branes are deﬁned in string perturbation\ntheory in a very simple way: they are surfaces where open strings can end. These\nopen strings have some massless modes, which describe the oscillations of the branes,\na gauge ﬁeld living on the brane, and their fermionic partners. If we have N coincident\nbranes the open strings can start and end on diﬀerent branes, so they carry two indices\nthat run from one to N. This in turn implies that the low energy dynamics is described\nby a U(N) gauge theory. D-p-branes are charged under p + 1-form gauge potentials,\nin the same way that a 0-brane (particle) can be charged under a one-form gauge\npotential (as in electromagnetism). These p + 1-form gauge potentials have p + 2-form\nﬁeld strengths, and they are part of the massless closed string modes, which belong to\nthe supergravity (SUGRA) multiplet containing the massless ﬁelds in ﬂat space string\ntheory (before we put in any D-branes). If we now add D-branes they generate a ﬂux of\nthe corresponding ﬁeld strength, and this ﬂux in turn contributes to the stress energy\ntensor so the geometry becomes curved. Indeed it is possible to ﬁnd solutions of the\nsupergravity equations carrying these ﬂuxes. Supergravity is the low-energy limit of\nstring theory, and it is believed that these solutions may be extended to solutions of\nthe full string theory. These solutions are very similar to extremal charged black hole\nsolutions in general relativity, except that in this case they are black branes with p\nextended spatial dimensions. Like black holes they contain event horizons.\nIf we consider a set of N coincident D-3-branes the near horizon geometry turns out\nto be AdS5 ×S5. On the other hand, the low energy dynamics on their worldvolume is\ngoverned by a U(N) gauge theory with N = 4 supersymmetry [9]. These two pictures of\nD-branes are perturbatively valid for diﬀerent regimes in the space of possible coupling\nconstants. Perturbative ﬁeld theory is valid when gsN is small, while the low-energy\ngravitational description is perturbatively valid when the radius of curvature is much\nlarger than the string scale, which turns out to imply that gsN should be very large. As\nan object is brought closer and closer to the black brane horizon its energy measured\nby an outside observer is redshifted, due to the large gravitational potential, and the\nenergy seems to be very small.\nOn the other hand low energy excitations on the\nbranes are governed by the Yang-Mills theory. So, it becomes natural to conjecture\nthat Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling is describing the near horizon region of\nthe black brane, whose geometry is AdS5 × S5. The ﬁrst indications that this is the\ncase came from calculations of low energy graviton absorption cross sections [10, 11,\n12]. It was noticed there that the calculation done using gravity and the calculation\ndone using super Yang-Mills theory agreed. These calculations, in turn, were inspired\nby similar calculations for coincident D1-D5 branes.\nIn this case the near horizon\ngeometry involves AdS3 × S3 and the low energy ﬁeld theory living on the D-branes"}

In this D1-D5 case there were numerous\ncalculations that agreed between the ﬁeld theory and gravity. First black hole entropy\nfor extremal black holes was calculated in terms of the ﬁeld theory in [13], and then\nagreement was shown for near extremal black holes [14, 15] and for absorption cross\nsections [16, 17, 18]. More generally, we will see that correlation functions in the gauge\ntheory can be calculated using the string theory (or gravity for large gsN) description,\nby considering the propagation of particles between diﬀerent points in the boundary\nof AdS, the points where operators are inserted [19, 20].\nSupergravities on AdS spaces were studied very extensively, see [21, 22] for reviews.\nSee also [23, 24] for earlier hints of the correspondence.\nOne of the main points of this review will be that the strings coming from gauge\ntheories are very much like the ordinary superstrings that have been studied during the\nlast 20 years. The only particular feature is that they are moving on a curved geometry\n(anti-de Sitter space) which has a boundary at spatial inﬁnity. The boundary is at an\ninﬁnite spatial distance, but a light ray can go to the boundary and come back in ﬁnite\ntime. Massive particles can never get to the boundary. The radius of curvature of\nAnti-de Sitter space depends on N so that large N corresponds to a large radius of\ncurvature. Thus, by taking N to be large we can make the curvature as small as we\nwant. The theory in AdS includes gravity, since any string theory includes gravity. So\nin the end we claim that there is an equivalence between a gravitational theory and a\nﬁeld theory. However, the mapping between the gravitational and ﬁeld theory degrees\nof freedom is quite non-trivial since the ﬁeld theory lives in a lower dimension. In some\nsense the ﬁeld theory (or at least the set of local observables in the ﬁeld theory) lives\non the boundary of spacetime. One could argue that in general any quantum gravity\ntheory in AdS deﬁnes a conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT) “on the boundary”. In some\nsense the situation is similar to the correspondence between three dimensional Chern-\nSimons theory and a WZW model on the boundary [25]. This is a topological theory in\nthree dimensions that induces a normal (non-topological) ﬁeld theory on the boundary.\nA theory which includes gravity is in some sense topological since one is integrating\nover all metrics and therefore the theory does not depend on the metric. Similarly,\nin a quantum gravity theory we do not have any local observables. Notice that when\nwe say that the theory includes “gravity on AdS” we are considering any ﬁnite energy\nexcitation, even black holes in AdS. So this is really a sum over all spacetimes that are\nasymptotic to AdS at the boundary. This is analogous to the usual ﬂat space discussion\nof quantum gravity, where asymptotic ﬂatness is required, but the spacetime could have\nany topology as long as it is asymptotically ﬂat. The asymptotically AdS case as well\nas the asymptotically ﬂat cases are special in the sense that one can choose a natural\ntime and an associated Hamiltonian to deﬁne the quantum theory. Since black holes\nmight be present this time coordinate is not necessarily globally well-deﬁned, but it is"}

This “holographic” principle comes from thinking about the\nBekenstein bound which states that the maximum amount of entropy in some region\nis given by the area of the region in Planck units [29]. The reason for this bound is\nthat otherwise black hole formation could violate the second law of thermodynamics.\nWe will see that the correspondence between ﬁeld theories and string theory on AdS\nspace (including gravity) is a concrete realization of this holographic principle.\nThe review is organized as follows.\nIn the rest of the introductory chapter, we present background material.

Many additional properties of the large\nN limit are discussed in [36, 34] and other references.\nThe analysis we did of the ’t Hooft limit for SU(N) theories with adjoint ﬁelds\ncan easily be generalized to other cases. Matter in the fundamental representation\nappears as single-line propagators in the diagrams, which correspond to boundaries of\nthe corresponding surfaces. Thus, if we have such matter we need to sum also over\nsurfaces with boundaries, as in open string theories. For SO(N) or USp(N) gauge\ntheories we can represent the adjoint representation as a product of two fundamental\nrepresentations (instead of a fundamental and an anti-fundamental representation),\nand the fundamental representation is real, so no arrows appear on the propagators in\nthe diagram, and the resulting surfaces may be non-orientable. Thus, these theories\nseem to be related to non-orientable string theories [37].

Various direct approaches towards constructing the relevant string\ntheory were attempted, many of which were based on the loop equations [46] for the\nWilson loop observables in the ﬁeld theory, which are directly connected to a string-\ntype description.\nAttempts to directly construct a string theory equivalent to a four dimensional gauge\ntheory are plagued with the well-known problems of string theory in four dimensions\n(or generally below the critical dimension).

In type IIA (IIB) theory, p is even (odd). The theory contains\nalso magnetically charged (6−p)-branes, which are electrically charged under the dual\ndA7−p = ∗dAp+1 potential. Therefore, R-R charges have to be quantized according to\nthe Dirac quantization condition. To ﬁnd the solution, we start with the low energy\neﬀective action in the string frame,"}

In particular, it can carry the R-R charges.\nIt was shown in [6] that, if we put N Dp-branes on top of each other, the resulting\n(p + 1)-dimensional hyperplane carries exactly N units of the (p + 1)-form charge. On\nthe worldsheet of a type II string, the left-moving degrees of freedom and the right-\nmoving degrees of freedom carry separate spacetime supercharges.\nSince the open\nstring boundary condition identiﬁes the left and right movers, the D-brane breaks at\nleast one half of the spacetime supercharges. In type IIA (IIB) string theory, precisely\none half of the supersymmetry is preserved if p is even (odd). This is consistent with\nthe types of R-R charges that appear in the theory. Thus, the Dp-brane is a BPS object\nin string theory which carries exactly the same charge as the black p-brane solution in\nsupergravity."}

An exact solution of a radial equation in terms of\nknown special functions is rare. We will therefore present a standard approximation\ntechnique (developed in [69] and applied to the problem at hand in [10]) which is\nsuﬃcient to obtain the leading term of (1.33). Besides, for comparison with string\ntheory predictions we are generally interested only in this leading term.\nThe idea is to ﬁnd limiting forms of the radial equation which can be solved exactly,\nand then to match the limiting solutions together to approximate the full solution.\nUsually a uniformly good approximation can be found in the limit of small energy. The\nreason, intuitively speaking, is that on a compact range of radii excluding asymptotic\ninﬁnity and the horizon, the zero energy solution is nearly equal to solutions with very\nsmall energy; and outside this region the wave equation usually has a simple limiting\nform. So one solves the equation in various regions and then matches together a global\nsolution."}

The\nfactor of 2κ2 is the square of the external leg factor for the incoming closed string\nstate, which was included in the invariant amplitude M. The factor of ωℓarises from\nacting with the ℓderivatives in (1.38) on the incoming plane wave state. The symbol\nDisc indicates that one is looking at the unitarity cut in the two-point function in the\ns plane, where s = p2. The two-point function can be reconstructed uniquely from\nthis cut, together with some weak conditions on regularity for large momenta. Results\nanalogous to (1.39) can be stated for incoming particles with spin, only it becomes\nmore complicated because a polarization must be speciﬁed, and the two-point function\nin momentum space includes a polynomial in p which depends on the polarization.\nExpressing absorption cross-sections in terms of two-point functions helps illustrate\nwhy there is ever agreement between the tree-level calculation indicated in (1.36) and\nthe supergravity result, which one would a priori expect to pick up all sorts of ra-\ndiative corrections. Indeed, it was observed in [12] that the s-wave graviton cross-\nsection agreed between supergravity and tree-level gauge theory because the correlator\n⟨TαβTγδ⟩enjoys a non-renormalization theorem. One way to see that there must be\nsuch a non-renormalization theorem is to note that conformal Ward identities relate\nthis two-point function to ⟨T µ\nµ TαβTγδ⟩(see for example [74] for the details), and su-\npersymmetry in turn relates this anomalous three-point function to the anomalous\nVEV’s of the divergence of R-currents in the presence of external sources for them.\nThe Adler-Bardeen theorem [75] protects these anomalies, hence the conclusion.\nAnother case which has been studied extensively is a system consisting of several\nD1 and D5 branes. The D1-branes are delocalized on the four extra dimensions of\nthe D5-brane, which are taken to be small, so that the total system is eﬀectively 1+1-"}

It is natural to look for possible\ngeneralizations of Poincar´e invariance in the hope that they may play some role in\nphysics; in [76] it was argued that for theories with a non-trivial S-matrix there are\nno such bosonic generalizations. An interesting generalization of Poincar´e invariance\nis the addition of a scale invariance symmetry linking physics at diﬀerent scales (this\nis inconsistent with the existence of an S-matrix since it does not allow the standard\ndeﬁnition of asymptotic states). Many interesting ﬁeld theories, like Yang-Mills theory\nin four dimensions, are scale-invariant; generally this scale invariance does not extend\nto the quantum theory (whose deﬁnition requires a cutoﬀwhich explicitly breaks scale\ninvariance) but in some special cases (such as the d = 4, N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-\nMills theory) it does, and even when it does not (like in QCD) it can still be a useful\ntool, leading to relations like the Callan-Symanzik equation. It was realized in the past\n30 years that ﬁeld theories generally exhibit a renormalization group ﬂow from some\nscale-invariant (often free) UV ﬁxed point to some scale-invariant (sometimes trivial)\nIR ﬁxed point, and statistical mechanics systems also often have non-trivial IR scale-\ninvariant ﬁxed points. Thus, studying scale-invariant theories is interesting for various\nphysical applications.\nIt is widely believed that unitary interacting scale-invariant theories are always in-\nvariant under the full conformal group, which is a simple group including scale invari-\nance and Poincar´e invariance. This has only been proven in complete generality for\ntwo dimensional ﬁeld theories [77, 78], but there are no known counter-examples. In\nthis section we will review the conformal group and its implications for ﬁeld theories,"}

Namely,\nAdSp+2 can be conformally mapped into one half of the Einstein static universe; the\nspacelike hypersurface of constant τ is a (p + 1)-dimensional hemisphere. The equator\nat θ = π/2 is a boundary of the space with the topology of Sp, as shown in ﬁgure 2.5\nin the case of p = 1. (In the case of AdS2, the coordinate θ ranges −π/2 ≤θ ≤π/2\nsince S0 consists of two points.) As in the case of the ﬂat space discussed earlier, the\nconformal compactiﬁcation is a convenient way to describe the asymptotic regions of\nAdS. In general, if a spacetime can be conformally compactiﬁed into a region which has\nthe same boundary structure as one half of the Einstein static universe, the spacetime\nis called asymptotically AdS.\nSince the boundary extends in the timelike direction labeled by τ, we need to specify\na boundary condition on the R × Sp at θ = π/2 in order to make the Cauchy problem\nwell-posed on AdS [98]. It turns out that the boundary of AdSp+2, or to be precise the\nboundary of the conformally compactiﬁed AdSp+2, is identical to the conformal com-\npactiﬁcation of the (p + 1)-dimensional Minkowski space. This fact plays an essential\nrole in the AdSp+2/CFTp+1 correspondence.\nIn addition to the global parametrization (2.22) of AdS, there is another set of\ncoordinates (u, t,⃗x) (0 < u,⃗x ∈Rp) which will be useful later.

The same is true in the anti-de\nSitter space if the theory has a positive deﬁnite Hamiltonian with respect to the global\ntime coordinate τ. Green functions of free ﬁelds on AdSp+2 have been computed in\n[99, 100] using this method.\nThe Euclidean AdSp+2 can be mapped into a (p+2)-dimensional disk. In the coordi-\nnates (u, tE,⃗x), u = ∞is the sphere Sp+1 at the boundary with one point removed. The\nfull boundary sphere is recovered by adding a point corresponding to u = 0 (or equiv-\nalently ⃗x = ∞). This is shown in ﬁgure 2.8 in the case of AdS2, for which z = tE + i/u\ngives a complex coordinate on the upper-half plane. By adding a point at inﬁnity, the\nupper-half plane is compactiﬁed into a disk. In the Lorentzian case, u = 0 represented\nthe Killing horizon giving the boundary of the (u, t,⃗x) coordinates. Since the u = 0\nplane is null in the Lorentzian case, it shrinks to a point in the Euclidean case."}

The spectrum of this compactiﬁcation is known from the work of [126, 85]. It is\na general feature of compactiﬁcations involving anti-de Sitter space that the positively\ncurved compact part has a radius of curvature on the same order as the negatively\ncurved anti-de Sitter part. As a result, the positive (mass)2 of Kaluza-Klein modes is\nof the same order as the negative (mass)2 of tachyonic modes. Thus there is no low-\nenergy limit in which one can argue that all but ﬁnitely many Kaluza-Klein harmonics\ndecouple. This was a traditional worry for all compactiﬁcations of eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity on squashed seven-spheres.\nHowever, fairly compelling evidence exists ([140] and references therein) that the\nreduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity on S7 can be consistently truncated to\nfour-dimensional N = 8 gauged supergravity. This is an exact statement about the\nequations of motion, and does not rely in any way on taking a low-energy limit. Put\nsimply, it means that any solution of the truncated theory can be lifted to a solution of\nthe untruncated theory. Charged black hole metrics in anti-de Sitter space provide a\nnon-trivial example of solutions that can be lifted to the higher-dimensional theory [141,\n142, 143].

It is a highly non-trivial claim that\nthis action, with its beautiful non-polynomial structure in the scalar ﬁelds, represents\na consistent truncation of the reduction of type IIB supergravity on S5.

For instance, the part of N = 8 ﬁve-dimensional\nsupergravity invariant under a particular SU(2) ⊂SO(6) is N = 4 gauged supergravity\ncoupled to two tensor multiplets [145]. A similar trunction to N = 6 supergravity was\nconsidered in [146].\nThe O(g2) term in the Lagrangian is particularly interesting: it is a potential V\nfor the scalars.

Roughly\nspeaking, one can think of the 40 remaining scalars as parametrizing a restricted class\nof deformations of the metric and 3-form ﬁelds on the S5, and of V as measuring the\nresponse of type IIB supergravity to these deformations. If the scalars are frozen to an\nextremum of V , then the value of the potential sets the cosmological constant in ﬁve\ndimensions. The associated conformal ﬁeld theories were discussed in [147, 148, 149].\nThe known extrema can be classiﬁed by the subset of the SO(6) global R-symmetry\ngroup that is preserved."}

This mass, which is the mass of the string stretching between the\nbranes sitting at ⃗r = 0 and the one at ⃗r, is proportional to U = r/α′, so this quantity\nshould remain ﬁxed in the decoupling limit.\nA U(N) gauge theory is essentially equivalent to a free U(1) vector multiplet times\nan SU(N) gauge theory, up to some ZN identiﬁcations (which aﬀect only global issues).\nIn the dual string theory all modes interact with gravity, so there are no decoupled\nmodes. Therefore, the bulk AdS theory is describing the SU(N) part of the gauge\ntheory. In fact we were not precise when we said that there were two sets of excitations\nat low energies, the excitations in the asymptotic ﬂat space and the excitations in\nthe near horizon region.\nThere are also some zero modes which live in the region\nconnecting the “throat” (the near horizon region) with the bulk, which correspond to\nthe U(1) degrees of freedom mentioned above. The U(1) vector supermultiplet includes\nsix scalars which are related to the center of mass motion of all the branes [151]. From\nthe AdS point of view these zero modes live at the boundary, and it looks like we might\nor might not decide to include them in the AdS theory. Depending on this choice we\ncould have a correspondence to an SU(N) or a U(N) theory. The U(1) center of mass\ndegree of freedom is related to the topological theory of B-ﬁelds on AdS [152]; if one\nimposes local boundary conditions for these B-ﬁelds at the boundary of AdS one ﬁnds\na U(1) gauge ﬁeld living at the boundary [153], as is familiar in Chern-Simons theories\n[25, 154].\nThese modes living at the boundary are sometimes called singletons (or\ndoubletons) [155, 127, 156, 87, 88, 157, 158, 159, 160].\nAs we saw in section 2.2, Anti-de-Sitter space has a large group of isometries, which\nis SO(4, 2) for the case at hand.

Thus, the fact that the low-energy ﬁeld theory on the brane is conformal\nis reﬂected in the fact that the near horizon geometry is Anti-de-Sitter space. We also\nhave some supersymmetries. The number of supersymmetries is twice that of the full\nsolution (3.3) containing the asymptotic region [151]. This doubling of supersymmetries\nis viewed in the ﬁeld theory as a consequence of superconformal invariance (section\n2.2.3), since the superconformal algebra has twice as many fermionic generators as the\ncorresponding Poincare superalgebra. We also have an SO(6) symmetry which rotates\nthe S5. This can be identiﬁed with the SU(4)R R-symmetry group of the ﬁeld theory.\nIn fact, the whole supergroup is the same for the N = 4 ﬁeld theory and the AdS5 ×S5"}

In particular, we need ∂U/U ≪U.\nSince (3.12) has the form L(gsN(∂U)2/U4), the higher order terms in (3.12) could\nbecome important in the supergravity regime, when gsN ≫1. The Born Infeld action\n(3.12), as always, makes sense only when the curvature of the brane is small, but the\ndeviations from a straight ﬂat brane could be large. In this regime we can keep the\nnon-linear terms in (3.12) while we still neglect the massive string modes and similar\neﬀects.

Suppose that we had a state with more entropy than Smax,\nthen we show that we could violate the second law of thermodynamics. We can throw\nin some extra matter such that we form a black hole. The entropy should not decrease.\nBut if a black hole forms inside the region its entropy is just the area of its horizon,\nwhich is smaller than the area of the boundary of the region (which by our assumption\nis smaller than the initial entropy). So, the second law has been violated.\nNote that this bound implies that the number of degrees of freedom inside some\nregion grows as the area of the boundary of a region and not like the volume of the\nregion. In standard quantum ﬁeld theories this is certainly not possible. Attempting\nto understand this behavior leads to the “holographic principle”, which states that in\na quantum gravity theory all physics within some volume can be described in terms of\nsome theory on the boundary which has less than one degree of freedom per Planck\narea [27, 28] (so that its entropy satisﬁes the Bekenstein bound).\nIn the AdS/CFT correspondence we are describing physics in the bulk of AdS space\nby a ﬁeld theory of one less dimension (which can be thought of as living on the\nboundary), so it looks like holography. However, it is hard to check what the number\nof degrees of freedom per Planck area is, since the theory, being conformal, has an\ninﬁnite number of degrees of freedom, and the area of the boundary of AdS space is\nalso inﬁnite. Thus, in order to compare things properly we should introduce a cutoﬀ\non the number of degrees of freedom in the ﬁeld theory and see what it corresponds to\nin the gravity theory.

It is natural to divide the operators into single-\ntrace operators and multiple-trace operators. In the ’t Hooft large N limit correlation\nfunctions involving multiple-trace operators are suppressed by powers of N compared\nto those of single-trace operators involving the same ﬁelds. We will discuss here in\ndetail only the single-trace operators; the multiple-trace operators appear in operator\nproduct expansions of products of single-trace operators.\nAs discussed in section 2.1, it is natural to classify the operators in a conformal\ntheory into primary operators and their descendants. In a superconformal theory it\nis also natural to distinguish between chiral primary operators, which are in short\nrepresentations of the superconformal algebra and are annihilated by some of the su-\npercharges, and non-chiral primary operators. Representations of the superconformal\nalgebra are formed by starting with some state of lowest dimension, which is anni-\nhilated by the operators S and Kµ, and acting on it with the operators Q and Pµ.\nThe N = 4 supersymmetry algebra involves 16 real supercharges. A generic primary\nrepresentation of the superconformal algebra will thus include 216 primaries of the\nconformal algebra, generated by acting on the lowest state with products of diﬀerent\nsupercharges; acting with additional supercharges always leads to descendants of the\nconformal algebra (i.e. derivatives). Since the supercharges have helicities ±1/2, the\nprimary ﬁelds in such representations will have a range of helicities between λ −4 (if\nthe lowest dimension operator ψ has helicity λ) and λ + 4 (acting with more than 8\nsupercharges of the same helicity either annihilates the state or leads to a conformal\ndescendant). In non-generic representations of the superconformal algebra a product\nof less than 16 diﬀerent Q’s annihilates the lowest dimension operator, and the range\nof helicities appearing is smaller. In particular, in the small representations of the\nN = 4 superconformal algebra only up to 4 Q’s of the same helicity acting on the\nlowest dimension operator give a non-zero result, and the range of helicities is between\nλ −2 and λ + 2. For the N = 4 supersymmetry algebra (not including the conformal\nalgebra) it is known that medium representations, whose range of helicities is 6, can\nalso exist (they arise, for instance, on the moduli space of the SU(N) N = 4 SYM\ntheory [188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195]); it is not clear if such medium repre-\nsentations of the superconformal algebra [196] can appear in physical theories or not\n(there are no known examples). More details on the structure of representations of the\nN = 4 superconformal algebra may be found in [85, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 196] and\nreferences therein."}

These operators form an ultra-short representation of the N = 4\nalgebra whose range of helicities is from (−1) to 1 (acting with more than two su-\npercharges of the same helicity on any of these states gives either zero or derivatives,\nwhich are descendants of the conformal algebra). All other local gauge invariant op-\nerators in the theory involve derivatives or products of these operators.\nThis rep-\nresentation is usually called the doubleton representation, and it does not appear\nin the SU(N) SYM theory (though the representations which do appear can all be\nformed by tensor products of the doubleton representation). In the context of AdS\nspace one can think of this multiplet as living purely on the boundary of the space\n[202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 87, 86, 207, 208, 209, 210], as expected for the U(1) part of\nthe original U(N) gauge group of the D3-branes (see the discussion in section 3.1).\nThere is no known simple systematic way to compute the full spectrum of chiral\nprimary operators of the N = 4 SU(N) SYM theory, so we will settle for presenting the\nknown chiral primary operators. The lowest component of a superconformal-primary\nmultiplet is characterized by the fact that it cannot be written as a supercharge Q\nacting on any other operator. Looking at the action of the supersymmetry charges\n(3.23) suggests that generally operators built from the fermions and the gauge ﬁelds\nwill be descendants (given by Q acting on some other ﬁelds), so one would expect\nthe lowest components of the chiral primary representations to be built only from the\nscalar ﬁelds, and this turns out to be correct.\nLet us analyze the behavior of operators of the form OI1I2···In ≡Tr(φI1φI2 · · · φIn).\nFirst we can ask if this operator can be written as {Q, ψ} for any ﬁeld ψ. In the\nSUSY algebra (3.23) only commutators of φI’s appear on the right hand side, so we see\nthat if some of the indices are antisymmetric the ﬁeld will be a descendant. Thus, only\nsymmetric combinations of the indices will be lowest components of primary multiplets.\nNext, we should ask if the multiplet built on such an operator is a (short) chiral\nprimary multiplet or not. There are several diﬀerent ways to answer this question.\nOne possibility is to use the relation between the dimension of chiral primary operators\nand their R-symmetry representation [94, 95, 96, 93, 97], and to check if this relation\nis obeyed in the free ﬁeld theory, where [OI1I2···In] = n. In this way we ﬁnd that the\nrepresentation is chiral primary if and only if the indices form a symmetric traceless\nproduct of n 6’s (traceless representations are deﬁned as those who give zero when\nany two indices are contracted). This is a representation of weight (0, n, 0) of SU(4)R;\nin this section we will refer to SU(4)R representations either by their dimensions in\nboldface or by their weights.\nAnother way to check this is to see if by acting with Q’s on these operators we get the\nmost general possible states or not, namely if the representation contains “null vectors”"}

Since the 60 does not appear on\nthe right-hand side (it is a “null vector”) we identify that the representation built on\nthe 20′ is a short representation of the SUSY algebra. By similar manipulations (see\n[20, 211, 197, 200] for more details) one can verify that chiral primary representations\ncorrespond exactly to symmetric traceless products of 6’s.\nIt is possible to analyze the chiral primary spectrum also by using N = 1 subalgebras\nof the N = 4 algebra. If we use an N = 1 subalgebra of the N = 4 algebra, as described\nabove, the operators On include the chiral operators of the form Tr(Φi1Φi2 · · · Φin) (in\na representation of SU(3) which is a symmetric product of 3’s), but for a particular\nchoice of the N = 1 subalgebra not all the operators On appear to be chiral (a short\nmultiplet of the N = 4 algebra includes both short and long multiplets of the N = 1\nsubalgebra).\nThe last issue we should discuss is what is the range of values of n.

The ﬁeld/operator\ncorrespondence matches this representation to the representation including the super-\nconformal currents in the ﬁeld theory. It includes a massless graviton ﬁeld, which (as\nexpected) corresponds to the energy-momentum tensor in the ﬁeld theory, and massless\nSU(4)R gauge ﬁelds which correspond to (or couple to) the global SU(4)R currents in\nthe ﬁeld theory.\nIn the naive dimensional reduction of the type IIB supergravity ﬁelds, the n = 1\ndoubleton representation, corresponding to a free U(1) vector multiplet in the dual\ntheory, also appears. However, the modes of this multiplet are all pure gauge modes in\nthe bulk of AdS5, and they may be set to zero there. This is one of the reasons why it\nseems more natural to view the corresponding gauge theory as an SU(N) gauge theory\nand not a U(N) theory. It may be possible (and perhaps even natural) to add the\ndoubleton representation to the theory (even though it does not include modes which\npropagate in the bulk of AdS5, but instead it is equivalent to a topological theory in\nthe bulk) to obtain a theory which is dual to the U(N) gauge theory, but this will not\naﬀect most of our discussion in this review so we will ignore this possibility here.\nComparing the results described above with the results of section 3.2.1, we see that\nwe ﬁnd the same spectrum of chiral primary operators for n = 2, 3, · · ·, N. The super-\ngravity results cannot be trusted for masses above the order of the string scale (which\ncorresponds to n ∼(gsN)1/4) or the Planck scale (which corresponds to n ∼N1/4), so\nthe results agree within their range of validity. The ﬁeld theory results suggest that the\nexact spectrum of chiral representations in type IIB string theory on AdS5×S5 actually\nmatches the naive supergravity spectrum up to a mass scale m2 ∼N2/R2 ∼N3/2M2\np\nwhich is much higher than the string scale and the Planck scale, and that there are no\nchiral ﬁelds above this scale. It is not known how to check this prediction; tree-level\nstring theory is certainly not enough for this since when gs = 0 we must take N = ∞to\nobtain a ﬁnite value of gsN. Thus, with our current knowledge the matching of chiral\nprimaries of the N = 4 SYM theory with those of string theory on AdS5 × S5 tests\nthe duality only in the large N limit. In some generalizations of the AdS/CFT corre-\nspondence the string coupling goes to zero at the boundary even for ﬁnite N, and then\nclassical string theory should lead to exactly the same spectrum of chiral operators as\nthe ﬁeld theory. This happens in particular for the near-horizon limit of NS5-branes, in\nwhich case the exact spectrum was successfully compared in [215]. In other instances\nof the AdS/CFT correspondence (such as the ones discussed in [216, 217, 218]) there\nexist also additional chiral primary multiplets with n of order N, and these have been\nsuccessfully matched with wrapped branes on the string theory side.\nThe fact that there seem to be no non-chiral ﬁelds on AdS5 with a mass below the\nstring scale suggests that for large N and large gsN, the dimension of all non-chiral\noperators in the ﬁeld theory, such as Tr(φIφI), grows at least as (gsN)1/4 ∼(g2\nY MN)1/4."}

Of course, if we do not require the string theory to have a supergravity\napproximation then there is no such restriction.\nFor both of the anomalies we described the ﬁeld theory and string theory computa-\ntions agree for the leading terms, which are of order N2. Thus, they are successful tests\nof the duality in the large N limit. For other instances of the AdS/CFT correspondence\nthere are corrections to anomalies at order 1/N ∼gs(α′/R2)2; such corrections were\ndiscussed in [231] and successfully compared in [232, 233, 234]6. It would be interesting\nto compare other corrections to the large N result.\nComputations of other correlation functions [235, 236, 237], such as 3-point func-\ntions of chiral primary operators and correlation functions which have only instanton\ncontributions (we will discuss these in section 4.2), have suggested that they are also\nthe same at small λ and at large λ, even though they are not related to anomalies in\nany known way. Perhaps there is some non-renormalization theorem also for these cor-\nrelation functions, in which case their agreement would also be a test of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. As discussed in [238, 239] (see also [146]) the non-renormalization\ntheorem for 3-point functions of chiral primary operators would follow from a conjec-\ntured U(1)Y symmetry of the 3-point functions of N = 4 SCFTs involving at least two\noperators which are descendants of chiral primaries7. This symmetry is a property of\ntype IIB supergravity on AdS5 × S5 but not of the full type IIB string theory."}

When we apply this relation to a Schwarzschild black\nhole in AdS5, which is thought to be reﬂected in the gauge theory by a thermal state\nat the Hawking temperature of the black hole, we arrive at the relation ISUGRA ≃βF.\nCalculating the free energy of a black hole from the Euclidean supergravity action has\na long tradition in the supergravity literature [241], so the main claim that is being\nmade here is that the dual gauge theory provides a description of the state of the black\nhole which is physically equivalent to the one in string theory. We will discuss the\nﬁnite temperature case further in section 3.6, and devote the rest of this section to the\npartition function of the ﬁeld theory on R4.\nThe main technical idea behind the bulk-boundary correspondence is that the bound-\nary values of string theory ﬁelds (in particular, supergravity ﬁelds) act as sources for\ngauge-invariant operators in the ﬁeld theory. From a D-brane perspective, we think of\nclosed string states in the bulk as sourcing gauge singlet operators on the brane which\noriginate as composite operators built from open strings.

In absorption calculations one\nis keeping the whole D3-brane geometry, not just the near-horizon AdS5 × S5 throat.\nThe usual treatment is to split the space into a near region (the throat) and a far\nregion. The incoming wave from asymptotically ﬂat inﬁnity can be regarded as ﬁxing\nthe value of a supergravity ﬁeld at the outer boundary of the near region. As usual,\nthe supergravity description is valid at large N and large ’t Hooft coupling. At small\n’t Hooft coupling, there is a diﬀerent description of the process: a cluster of D3-branes\nsits at some location in ﬂat ten-dimensional space, and the incoming wave impinges\nupon it. In the low-energy limit, the value of the supergravity ﬁeld which the D3-branes\nfeel is the same as the value in the curved space description at the boundary of the\nnear horizon region. Equation (3.34) is just a mathematical expression of the fact that\nthe throat geometry should respond identically to the perturbed supergravity ﬁelds as\nthe low-energy theory on the D3-branes.\nFollowing [19, 20], a number of papers—notably [242, 243, 219, 244, 220, 245, 246,\n235, 247, 236, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254]—have undertaken the program of ex-\ntracting explicit n-point correlation functions of gauge singlet operators by developing\nboth sides of (3.34) in a power series in φ0. Because the right hand side is the extrem-\nization of a classical action, the power series has a graphical representation in terms\nof tree-level Feynman graphs for ﬁelds in the supergravity. There is one diﬀerence: in\nordinary Feynman graphs one assigns the wavefunctions of asymptotic states to the\nexternal legs of the graph, but in the present case the external leg factors reﬂect the\nboundary values φ0. They are special limits of the usual gravity propagators in the\nbulk, and are called bulk-to-boundary propagators. We will encounter their explicit\nform in the next two sections."}

If we evaluate\nthe area up to some radial distance U = r, we see that for large r it diverges as"}

On the other\nhand, the perturbative computation in the ﬁeld theory shows that ⟨W⟩, for W given\nby (3.85), is ﬁnite, as it should be since a divergence in the Wilson loop would have\nimplied a mass renormalization of the BPS particle. The apparent discrepancy between\nthe divergence of the area of the minimum surface in AdS and the ﬁniteness of the\nﬁeld theory computation can be reconciled by noting that the appropriate action for\nthe string worldsheet is not the area itself but its Legendre transform with respect to\nthe string coordinates corresponding to θI and the radial coordinate u [296]. This is\nbecause these string coordinates obey the Neumann boundary conditions rather than\nthe Dirichlet conditions. When the loop is smooth, the Legendre transformation simply\nsubtracts the divergent term r|C|, leaving the resulting action ﬁnite.\nAs an example let us consider a circular Wilson loop. Take C to be a circle of radius\na on the boundary, and let us work in the Poincar´e coordinates (deﬁned in section\n2.2). We could ﬁnd the surface that minimizes the area by solving the Euler-Lagrange\nequations. However, in this case it is easier to use conformal invariance. Note that\nthere is a conformal transformation in the ﬁeld theory that maps a line to a circle. In\nthe case of the line, the minimum area surface is clearly a plane that intersects the\nboundary and goes all the way to the horizon (which is just a point on the boundary\nin the Euclidean case). Using the conformal transformation to map the line to a circle\nwe obtain the minimal surface we want. It is, using the coordinates (3.17) for AdS5,"}

This indicates some screening of the charges at strong coupling.\nThe above calculation makes sense for all distances L when gsN is large, independently\nof the value of gs. Some subleading corrections coming from quantum ﬂuctuations of\nthe worldsheet were calculated in [298, 299, 300].\nIn a similar fashion we could compute the potential between two magnetic monopoles\nin terms of a D-string worldsheet, and the result will be the same as (3.95) but with\ngY M →4π/gY M. One can also calculate the interaction between a magnetic monopole\nand a quark. In this case the fundamental string (ending on the quark) will attach to\nthe D-string (ending on the monopole), and they will connect to form a (1, 1) string\nwhich will go into the horizon. The resulting potential is a complicated function of\ngY M [301], but in the limit that gY M is small (but still with g2\nY MN large) we get\nthat the monopole-quark potential is just 1/4 of the quark-quark potential. This can\nbe understood from the fact that when g is small the D-string is very rigid and the\nfundamental string will end almost perpendicularly on the D-string. Therefore, the\nsolution for the fundamental string will be half of the solution we had above, leading\nto a factor of 1/4 in the potential. Calculations of Wilson loops in the Higgs phase\nwere done in [302].\nAnother interesting case one can study analytically is a surface near a cusp on R4.\nIn this case, the perturbative computation in the gauge theory shows a logarithmic\ndivergence with a coeﬃcient depending on the angle at the cusp.\nThe area of the\nminimum surface also contains a logarithmic divergence depending on the angle [296].\nOther aspects of the gravity calculation of Wilson loops were discussed in [303, 304,\n305, 306, 307]."}

In particular one could consider the “Wilson\nsurfaces” that arise in the six dimensional N = (2, 0) theory which will be discussed in\nsection 6.1.1.

The strong\ncoupling result follows from considering the leading α′ corrections to the supergravity\naction. The relevant one involves a particular contraction of four powers of the Weyl\ntensor. It is important now to work with the Euclidean solution, and one restricts\nattention further to the near-horizon limit. The Weyl curvature comes from the non-\ncompact part of the metric, which is no longer AdS5 but rather the AdS-Schwarzschild\nsolution which we will discuss in more detail in section 3.6.2. The action including\nthe α′ corrections no longer has the Einstein-Hilbert form, and correspondingly the\nBekenstein-Hawking prescription no longer agrees with the free energy computed as βI\nwhere I is the Euclidean action. In keeping with the basic prescription for computing\nGreen’s functions, where a free energy in ﬁeld theory is equated (in the appropriate\nlimit) with a supergravity action, the relation I = βF is regarded as the correct\none. (See [314].) It has been conjectured that the interpolating function f(g2\nY MN)\nis not smooth, but exhibits some phase transition at a ﬁnite value of the ’t Hooft\ncoupling. We regard this as an unsettled question. The arguments in [315, 316] seem\nas yet incomplete.

String amplitudes\n(when we can calculate them) render on-shell quantities well-deﬁned.

Multiple classical conﬁgurations are possible be-\ncause of the general feature of boundary value problems in diﬀerential equations: there\ncan be multiple solutions to the classical equations satisfying the same asymptotic\nboundary conditions.

In the gauge theory we interpret this transition as a conﬁnement-deconﬁnement\ntransition. Since the theory is conformally invariant, the transition temperature must\nbe proportional to the inverse radius of the space S3 which the ﬁeld theory lives on.\nSimilar transitions, and also local thermodynamic instability due to negative speciﬁc\nheats, have been studied in the context of spinning branes and charged black holes"}

Most of these works are best understood on\nthe CFT side as explorations of exotic thermal phenomena in ﬁnite-temperature gauge\ntheories. Connections with Higgsed states in gauge theory are clearer in [322, 323].\nThe relevance to conﬁnement is explored in [320]. See also [324, 325, 326, 285] for\nother interesting contributions to the ﬁnite temperature literature.\nDeconﬁnement at high temperature can be characterized by a spontaneous breaking\nof the center of the gauge group. In our case the gauge group is SU(N) and its center\nis ZN. The order parameter for the breaking of the center is the expectation value of\nthe Polyakov (temporal) loop ⟨W(C)⟩. The boundary of the spaces X1, X2 is S3 × S1,\nand the path C wraps around the circle. An element of the center g ∈ZN acts on the\nPolyakov loop by ⟨W(C)⟩→g⟨W(C)⟩. The expectation value of the Polyakov loop\nmeasures the change of the free energy of the system Fq(T) induced by the presence\nof the external charge q, ⟨W(C)⟩∼exp (−Fq(T)/T). In a conﬁning phase Fq(T) is\ninﬁnite and therefore ⟨W(C)⟩= 0. In the deconﬁned phase Fq(T) is ﬁnite and therefore\n⟨W(C)⟩̸= 0.\nAs discussed in section 3.5, in order to compute ⟨W(C)⟩we have to evaluate the\npartition function of strings with a worldsheet D that is bounded by the loop C.\nConsider ﬁrst the low temperature phase. The relevant space is X1 which, as discussed\nabove, has the topology B4 ×S1. The contour C wraps the circle and is not homotopic\nto zero in X1. Therefore C is not a boundary of any D, which immediately implies\nthat ⟨W(C)⟩= 0. This is the expected behavior at low temperatures (compared to\nthe inverse radius of the S3), where the center of the gauge group is not broken.\nFor the high temperature phase the relevant space is X2, which has the topology\nS3 × B2. The contour C is now a boundary of a string worldsheet D = B2 (times a\npoint in S3). This seems to be in agreement with the fact that in the high temperature\nphase ⟨W(C)⟩̸= 0 and the center of the gauge group is broken. It was pointed out\nin [185] that there is a subtlety with this argument, since the center should not be\nbroken in ﬁnite volume (S3), but only in the inﬁnite volume limit (R3). Indeed, the\nsolution X2 is not unique and we can add to it an expectation value for the integral\nof the NS-NS 2-form ﬁeld B on B2, with vanishing ﬁeld strength. This is an angular\nparameter ψ with period 2π, which contributes iψ to the string worldsheet action. The\nstring theory partition function includes now an integral over all values of ψ, making\n⟨W(C)⟩= 0 on S3. In contrast, on R3 one integrates over the local ﬂuctuations of\nψ but not over its vacuum expectation value. Now ⟨W(C)⟩̸= 0 and depends on the\nvalue of ψ ∈U(1), which may be understood as the dependence on the center ZN in\nthe large N limit. Explicit computations of Polyakov loops at ﬁnite temperature were\ndone in [327, 328].\nIn [185] the Euclidean black hole solution (3.103) was suggested to be holographically\ndual to a theory related to pure QCD in three dimensions.

The spectrum of ﬁelds on AdS5 in this\nbackground was successfully compared [356] to the spectrum of chiral operators in the\nﬁeld theory. If we move in the string theory moduli space to a point where the B-\nﬁelds on some 2-cycles are turned oﬀ, the D3-branes wrapped around these 2-cycles\nbecome tensionless, and the low-energy theory becomes a non-trivial N = (2, 0) six\ndimensional SCFT (see [93] and references therein).\nThe low-energy spectrum on\nAdS5 then includes the dimensional reduction of this conformal theory on a circle. In\nparticular, when all the B-ﬁelds are turned oﬀ, we get the Ak−1 (2, 0) theory, which gives\nrise to SU(k) gauge ﬁelds at low-energies upon compactiﬁcation on a circle. Thus, the\nAdS/CFT correspondence predicts an enhanced global SU(k) symmetry at a particular\npoint in the parameter space of the corresponding ﬁeld theory. Presumably, this point\nis in a very strongly coupled regime (the string coupling τIIB ∝P\ni τi may be chosen\nto be weak, but individual τi’s can still be strongly coupled) which cannot be accessed\ndirectly in the ﬁeld theory. The ﬁeld theory in this case has a large group of duality\nsymmetries [353], which includes (but is not limited to) the SL(2, Z) subgroup which\nacts on the couplings as τ →(aτ + b)/(cτ + d) at the point where they are all equal.\nIn the type IIB background the SL(2, Z) subgroup of this duality group is manifest,\nbut it is not clear how to see the rest of this group.\nOur second example corresponds to D3-branes at an R6/Z3 orbifold point, where, if\nwe write R6 as C3 with complex coordinates zj (j = 1, 2, 3), the Z3 acts as zj →e2πi/3zj.\nIn this case the only ﬁxed point of the Z3 action is the origin, so in the near-horizon\nlimit we get [330] AdS5 × S5/Z3 where the compact space is smooth.

The parameter which parameterizes this ﬁxed line (which passes\nthrough weak coupling in the gauge theory) may be identiﬁed with the dilaton in the\nAdS5 × S5/Z3 background. Unlike the previous case, here there are no indications of\nadditional marginal deformations, and no massless twisted sector states on AdS5 which\nthey could correspond to.\nAs in the previous case, one can try to compare the spectrum of ﬁelds on AdS5\nwith the spectrum of chiral operators in the ﬁeld theory. In this case, as in all cases\nwith less than N = 4 supersymmetry, not all the supergravity ﬁelds on AdS5 are in\nchiral multiplets, since the N = 4 chiral multiplets split into chiral, anti-chiral and\nnon-chiral multiplets when decomposed into N = 2 (or N = 1) representations8 (in\ngeneral there can also be various sizes of chiral multiplets). However, one can still\ncompare those of the ﬁelds which are in chiral multiplets (and have the appropriate\nrelations between their AdS mass / ﬁeld theory dimension and their R-charges). The\nuntwisted states may easily be matched since they are a projection of the original\nstates both in space-time and in the ﬁeld theory (if we think of the ﬁeld theory as a\nprojection of the N = 4 SU(3N) gauge theory). Looking at the twisted sectors we\nseem to encounter a paradox [333]. On the string theory side all the twisted sector\nstates are heavy (they correspond to strings stretched across the S5, so they would\ncorrespond to operators with ∆≃mR ≃R2/l2\ns ≃(gsN)1/2). On the ﬁeld theory side\nwe can identify the twisted sector ﬁelds with operators which are charged under the\nglobal Z3 symmetry which rotates the three gauge groups, and naively there exist chiral\noperators which are charged under this symmetry and remain of ﬁnite dimension in the\nlarge N, g2\nY MN limit. However, a careful analysis shows that all of these operators are\nin fact descendants, so their dimensions are not protected. For example, the operator\nP3\nj=1 e2πij/3Tr((W (j)\nα )2), where W (j)\nα\nis the ﬁeld strength multiplet of the j’th SU(N)\ngroup, seems to be a chiral superﬁeld charged under the Z3 symmetry. However, using\nlinear combinations of the Konishi anomaly equations [357, 358] for the three gauge\ngroups, one can show that this operator (and all other “twisted sector” operators) is in"}

We will focus here on two examples which illustrate some\nof the general properties of these backgrounds. Additional examples were discussed in\n[362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369].\nOur ﬁrst example is the near-horizon limit of D3-branes on an orientifold 3-plane.\nThe orientifold breaks the same supersymmetries as the 3-branes do, so in the near\nhorizon limit we have the full 32 supercharges corresponding to a d = 4, N = 4 SCFT.\nIn ﬂat space there are (see [370] and references therein) two types of orientifold planes\nwhich lead to diﬀerent projections on D-brane states. One type of orientifold plane\nleads to a low-energy SO(2N) N = 4 gauge theory for N D-branes on the orientifold,\nwhile the other leads to a USp(2N) N = 4 gauge theory. In the ﬁrst case we can also\nhave an additional “half D3-brane” stuck on the orientifold, leading to an SO(2N + 1)\nN = 4 gauge theory.

The manifestation\nof the orientifolding in the near-horizon limit is that when a string goes around a\nnon-contractible cycle in RP5 (connecting opposite points of the S5) its orientation\nis reversed. In all the cases discussed above the string theory perturbation expansion\nhad only closed orientable surfaces, so it was a power series in g2\ns (or in 1/N2 in the\n’t Hooft limit); but in this background we can also have non-orientable closed surfaces\nwhich include crosscaps, and the perturbation expansion includes also odd powers of\ngs (or of 1/N in the ’t Hooft limit).

In the Feynman diagram expansion\nit is well-known [371, 372] that the SO(2N) and USp(2N) theories are related by a\ntransformation taking N to (−N), which inverts the sign of all diagrams with an odd\nnumber of crosscaps in the ’t Hooft limit. Thus, we should look for a similar eﬀect in\nstring theory on AdS5×RP5. It turns out [216] that this is implemented by a “discrete\ntorsion” on RP5, corresponding to turning on a BNS−NS 2-form in the non-trivial co-\nhomology class of H3(RP5, ˜Z) = Z2. The eﬀect of turning on this “discrete torsion” is\nexactly to invert the sign of all string diagrams with an odd number of crosscaps. It is\nalso possible to turn on a similar “discrete torsion” for the RR 2-form B-ﬁeld, so there\nis a total of four diﬀerent possible string theories on AdS5 × RP5. It turns out that\nthe theory with no B-ﬁelds is equivalent to the SO(2N) N = 4 gauge theory, which\nis self-dual under the S-duality group SL(2, Z). The theory with only a non-zero BRR\nﬁeld is equivalent to the SO(2N + 1) gauge theory, while the theories with non-zero\nBNS−NS ﬁelds are equivalent to the USp(2N) gauge theory [216], and this is consistent\nwith the action of S-duality on these groups and on the 2-form B-ﬁelds (which are a\ndoublet of SL(2, Z)).\nAn interesting test of this correspondence is the matching of chiral primary ﬁelds.\nIn the supergravity limit the ﬁelds on AdS5 × RP5 are just the Z2 projection of the\nﬁelds on AdS5 × S5, including the multiplets with n = 2, 4, 6, · · · (in the notation of\nsection 3.2). This matches with almost all the chiral superﬁelds in the corresponding\ngauge theories, which are described as traces of products of the fundamental ﬁelds as\nin section 3.2, but with the trace of a product of an odd number of ﬁelds vanishing in\nthese theories from symmetry arguments. However, in the SO(2N) gauge theories (and\nnot in any of the others) there is an additional gauge invariant chiral superﬁeld, called\nthe Pfaﬃan, whose lowest component is of the form ǫa1a2···a2NφI1\na1a2φI2\na3a4 · · ·φIN\na2N−1a2N,\nwhere ai are SO(2N) indices and the Ij are (symmetric traceless) indices in the 6 of\nSU(4)R.

Anomaly matching in this background was discussed\nin [233].\nAnother interesting background is the near-horizon limit of D3-branes on an orien-\ntifold 7-plane, with 4 D7-branes coincident on the orientifold plane to ensure [373, 374]\nthat the dilaton is constant and the low-energy theory is conformal (this is the same\nas D3-branes in F-theory [375] at a D4-type singularity). The ﬁeld theory we get in\nthe near-horizon limit in this case is [376, 377] an N = 2 SQCD theory with USp(2N)\ngauge group, a hypermultiplet in the anti-symmetric representation and four hyper-\nmultiplets in the fundamental representation. In this case the orientifold action has\nﬁxed points on the S5, so the near-horizon limit is [378, 379] type IIB string theory\non AdS5 × S5/Z2 where the Z2 action has ﬁxed points on an S3 inside the S5. Thus,\nthis background includes an orientifold plane with the topology of S3 × AdS5, and the\nD7-branes stretched along the orientifold plane also remain as part of the background,\nso that the low-energy theory includes both the supergravity modes in the bulk and the\nSO(8) gauge theory on the D7-branes (which corresponds to an SO(8) global symme-\ntry in the corresponding ﬁeld theories)9. The string perturbation expansion in this case\nhas two sources of corrections of order gs, the crosscap diagram and the open string\ndisc diagram with strings ending on the D7-brane, leading to two types of corrections\nof order 1/N in the ’t Hooft limit. Again, the spectrum of operators in the ﬁeld theory\nmay be matched [379] with the spectrum of ﬁelds coming from the dimensional reduc-\ntion of the supergravity theory in the bulk and of the 7-brane theory wrapped on the\nS3. The anomalies may also be matched to the ﬁeld theory, including 1/N corrections\nto the leading large N result [232] which arise from disc and crosscap diagrams.\nBy studying other backgrounds of D3-branes with 7-branes (with or without ori-\nentifolds) one can obtain non-conformal theories which exhibit a logarithmic running\nof the coupling constant [379, 380]. For instance, by separating the D7-branes away\nfrom the orientifold plane, corresponding to giving a mass to the hypermultiplets in\nthe fundamental representation, one ﬁnds string theory solutions in which the dilaton"}

In the case of\na D5-brane, these N strings are fundamental strings (one could also consider SL(2, Z)\nimages of this conﬁguration). The argument is a slight variant of the ones used in the\ndiscussion of anomalous brane creation [404, 405, 406]. There are N units of ﬁve-form\n(F5) ﬂux on the S5, and the coupling\n1"}

Since\nthe D5-brane spatial world-volume is closed, the total charge must be zero. A string\nrunning out of the D5-brane counts as (−1) unit of U(1) charge, hence the conclusion.\nReversing the orientation of the D5-brane changes the sign of the charge induced by\nF5, and correspondingly the N strings should run into the brane rather than out.\nIn the absence of other D-branes, the strings cannot end anywhere in AdS5, so they\nmust run out to the boundary. A string ending on the boundary is interpreted (see sec-\ntion 3.5) as an electric charge in the fundamental representation of the SU(N) gauge\ngroup: an external (non-dynamical) quark. This interpretation comes from viewing\nthe strings as running from the D5-brane to a D3-brane at inﬁnity. It was shown in\n[405] that such stretched strings have a unique ground state which is fermionic, and\nthe conclusion is that the D5-brane “baryon” is precisely an antisymmetric combina-\ntion of N fermionic fundamental string “quarks.” The gauge theory interpretation is\nclear: because the gauge group is SU(N) rather than U(N), there is a gauge-invariant\nbaryonic vertex for N external fundamental quarks. We will return to a discussion of\nbaryonic objects in section 6.2.2.\nTo obtain other types of wrapped brane objects with no spatial extent in AdS5, we\nmust turn to compact manifolds with more nontrivial homology cycles. Apart from the\nintrinsic interest of studying such objects and the gauge theories in which they occur,\nthe idea is to verify the claim that every object we can exhibit in gauge theory has a\nstringy counterpart, and vice versa.\nFollowing [216] and the discussion in section 4.1.2, we now examine wrapped branes\nin the AdS5 × RP5 geometry, which is the near-horizon geometry of D3-branes placed\non top of a Z2 orientifold three-plane (the Z2 acts as xi →−xi for the six coordinates\nperpendicular to the D3-branes). H3(RP5, Z) = Z2, and the generator of the homology\ngroup is a projective space RP3 ⊂RP5. This seems to oﬀer the possibility of wrapping\na D3-brane on a 3-cycle to get a particle in AdS5. However, there is a caveat: as argued\nin [216] the wrapping is permitted only if there is no discrete torsion for the NS and\nRR B-ﬁelds. In gauge theory terms, that amounts to saying that the corresponding"}

We have suppressed their global ﬂavor index. A similar wrapped\n3-brane was discussed in section 4.1.3, where the 3-brane was wrapped around the\n3-cycle of T 11 (which is topologically S2 × S3).\nIt is also interesting to consider branes with spatial extent in AdS5. Strings in AdS5\nwere discussed in section 3.5. A three-brane in AdS5 (by which we mean any wrapped\nbrane with three dimensions of spatial extent in AdS5) aligned with one direction\nperpendicular to the boundary must correspond to some sort of domain wall in the\nﬁeld theory. Some examples are obvious: in AdS5 × S5, if the three-brane is a D3-\nbrane, then crossing the domain wall shifts the 5-form ﬂux and changes the gauge group\nfrom SU(N) to SU(N + 1) or SU(N −1). A less obvious example was considered in\n[216]: crossing a D5-brane or NS5-brane wrapped on some RP2 ⊂RP5 changes the\ndiscrete torsion of the RR or NS B-ﬁeld, and so one can switch between SO(N) and\nSp(N/2) gauge groups. D5-branes on homology 2-cycles of the base of conifolds and\norbifolds have also been studied [218, 383, 359, 407], and the conclusion is that they\ncorrespond to domain walls across which the rank of some factor in the product gauge\ngroup is incremented.\nAnother brane wrapping possibility is branes with two dimensions of spatial extent\nin AdS5. These become strings in the gauge theory when they are oriented with one\ndimension along the radial direction. In a particular model (an SU(N)3 gauge theory\nwhose string theory image is AdS5×S5/Z3) the authors of [359] elucidated their mean-\ning: they are strings which give rise to a monodromy for the wave-functions of particles\ntransported around them. The monodromy belongs to a discrete symmetry group of\nthe gauge theory. The familiar example of such a phenomenon is the Aharonov-Bohm\neﬀect, where the electron’s wave-function picks up a U(1) phase when it is transported\naround a tube of magnetic ﬂux. The analysis of [359] extends beyond their speciﬁc\nmodel, and applies in particular to strings in SO(N) gauge theories, with N even,\nobtained from wrapping a D3-brane on a generator of H1(RP5, Z), where the RP5 has\nno discrete torsion.\nFinally, we turn to one of the most familiar examples of a non-perturbative object\nin gauge theory: the instanton. The obvious candidate in string theory to describe an\ninstanton is the D-instanton, also known as the D(-1)-brane. The correspondence in"}

First we are going to describe\nsome generalities which are valid for any AdS3 quantum gravity theory, and then we\nwill discuss in more detail IIB string theory compactiﬁed on AdS3 × S3 × M4 with\nM4 = K3 or T 4.\nAdS3 quantum gravity is conjectured to be dual to a two dimensional conformal ﬁeld\ntheory which can be thought of as living on the boundary of AdS3. The boundary of\nAdS3 (in global coordinates) is a cylinder, so the conformal ﬁeld theory is deﬁned on\nthis cylinder. We choose the cylinder to have radius one, which is the usual convention\nfor conformal ﬁeld theories. Of course, all circles are equivalent since this is a conformal\nﬁeld theory, but we have to rescale energies accordingly. If the spacetime theory or\nthe conformal ﬁeld theory contain fermions then they have anti-periodic boundary\nconditions on the circle. The reason is that the circle is contractible in AdS3, and close\nto the “center” of AdS3 a translation by 2π on the circle looks like a rotation by 2π,\nand fermions get a minus sign. So, the dual conformal ﬁeld theory is in the NS-NS\nsector. Note that we will not sum over sectors as we do in string theory, since in this\ncase the conformal ﬁeld theory describes string theory on the given spacetime and all\nits ﬁnite energy excitations, and we do not have to second-quantize it."}

We could consider the canonical ensemble by going to Euclidean\nspace and making the Euclidean time coordinate periodic, τ = τ + β. We consider the\ncase Ω= 0, the general case is considered in [278]. The conformal ﬁeld theory is then\ndeﬁned on a rectangular two-torus, and the free energy will be the partition function\nof the theory on this two-torus. Due to the thermal boundary condition in the NS\nsector, the two-torus ends up having NS-NS boundary conditions on both circles. In\norder to calculate the partition function in the dual gravitational theory we should ﬁnd\na three-manifold that has the two-torus as its boundary (the correspondence tells us\nto sum over all such manifolds). One possibility is to have the original AdS3 space\nbut with time identiﬁed, τ = τ + β. The value of the free energy is then given, to\nleading order, by the ground state energy of AdS3. This is the expected result for\nlarge β, where the torus is very elongated and only the vacuum propagates in the τ\nchannel, see ﬁgure 5.1(a). For high temperatures, only the vacuum propagates in the\ncrossed channel (ﬁg. 5.1(b)), and this corresponds to the BTZ black hole in AdS3.\nNote that the Euclidean BTZ geometry is the same as AdS3 but “on its side”, with\nτ ↔φ, so now the τ circle is contractible.

The ﬁeld theory living\non D1-D5 branes, before we go to the IR ﬁxed point, is some 1 + 1 dimensional ﬁeld\ntheory with N = (4, 4) supersymmetry. This amount of supersymmetry is equivalent to\nN = 2 in four dimensions, so we can classify the multiplets in a similar fashion. There\nis a vector multiplet and a hypermultiplet. In two dimensions both multiplets have the\nsame propagating degrees of freedom, four scalars and four fermions, but they have\ndiﬀerent properties under the SU(2)L × SU(2)R global R-symmetry. Under this group\nthe scalars in the hypermultiplets are in the trivial representation, while the scalars\nin the vector multiplet are in the (2, 2). On the fermions these global symmetries\nact chirally. The left moving vector multiplet fermions are in the (1, 2), and the left\nmoving hypermultiplet fermions are in the (2, 1). The right moving fermions have\nsimilar properties with SU(2)L ↔SU(2)R. The theory can have a Coulomb branch\nwhere the scalars in the vector multiplets have expectation values, and a Higgs branch\nwhere the scalars in the hypermultiplets have expectation values.\nFrom the spacetime origin of the supercharges it is clear that the SU(2)L × SU(2)R\nglobal R-symmetry is the same as the SO(4) symmetry of spatial rotations in the 4-\nplane orthogonal to the D1-D5 system [454, 455, 456]. The vector multiplets describe\nmotion of the branes in the transverse directions, this is consistent with their SO(4)\ntransformation properties. The vector multiplet “expectation values” should be zero\nif we want the branes to be on top of each other. We have put quotation marks since\nexpectation values do not exist in a 1 + 1 dimensional ﬁeld theory. It is possible to\nshow that if Q1 and Q5 are coprime then, by turning on some of the M4 moduli (more\nprecisely some NS B-ﬁelds), one can remove the Coulomb branch altogether, forcing\nthe branes to be at the same point in the transverse directions [457, 343].\nSince the fermions transform chirally under SU(2)L, this theory has a chiral anomaly.\nThe chiral anomaly for SU(2)L is proportional to the number of left moving fermions\nminus the number of right moving fermions that transform under this symmetry. The\n’t Hooft anomaly matching conditions imply that this anomaly should be the same at\nhigh and low energies [458]. At high energies (high compared to the IR ﬁxed point)\nthe anomaly is ka = NH −NV , the diﬀerence between the number of vector multiplets\nand hypermultiplets.\nLet us now calculate this, starting with the T 4 case.\nOn a\nD1-D5 brane worldvolume there are massless excitations coming from (1,1) strings,\n(5,5) strings and (1,5) (and (5,1)) strings.\nThe (1,1) or (5,5) strings come from a\nvector multiplet of an N = (8, 8) theory, which gives rise to both a vector multiplet\nand a hypermultiplet of N = (4, 4) supersymmetry, so they do not contribute to the\nanomaly. The massless modes of the (1,5) strings come only in hypermultiplets, and"}

For the K3 case the analysis is similar.\nThe D5 branes are now wrapped on K3, so the (5,5) strings give rise only to a vector\nmultiplet. The diﬀerence from the T 4 case comes from the fact that in the T 4 case\nthe (5,5) hypermultiplet came from Wilson lines on the torus, and on K3 we do not\nhave one-cycles so we do not have Wilson lines. On the ﬁvebrane worldvolume there\nis (when it is wrapped on K3) an induced one-brane charge equal to Qind\n1\n= −Q5. The\ntotal D1 brane charge is equal to the sum of the charges carried by explicit D1 branes\nand this negative induced charge, Q1 = Qind\n1\n+ QD1\n1\n[459]. Therefore, the number of\nD1 branes is really QD1\n1\n= Q1 + Q5, and the number of (1,5) strings is QD1\n1 Q5. So,\nwe conclude that the anomaly is ka = QD1\n1 Q5 −Q2\n5 = Q1Q5, which in the end is the\nsame result as in the T 4 case. Note that in order to calculate this anomaly we only\nneed to know the massless ﬁelds, since all massive ﬁelds live in larger representations\nwhich are roughly like a vector multiplet plus a hypermultiplet, and therefore they do\nnot contribute to the anomaly.\nWhen we are on the Higgs branch all the vectors become massive except for the center\nof mass multiplet, which contains ﬁelds describing the overall motion of all the branes\nin the four transverse directions. This is just a free multiplet, containing four scalar\nﬁelds. On the Higgs branch, at the IR ﬁxed point, the SU(2)L symmetry becomes a\ncurrent algebra with an anomaly kcft. The total anomaly should be the same, so that\nka = kcft−1. The last term comes from the center of mass U(1) vector multiplet (which\nis not included in kcft). So, we conclude that kcft = Q1Q5 + 1. Since the U(1) vector\nmultiplet is decoupled, we drop it in the rest of the discussion and we talk only about\nthe conformal ﬁeld theory of the hypermultiplets.\nThe N = (4, 4) superconformal\nsymmetry relates the anomaly in the SU(2) current algebra to the central charge,\nc = 6kcft = 6(Q1Q5 + 1). Using the value for the AdS3 radius R = (g2\n6Q1Q5)1/4ls and\nthe three dimensional Newton constant G(3)\nN = g2\n6l4\ns/4R3, we can now check that (5.4)\nis satisﬁed to leading order for large k. This also ensures, as we saw above, that the\nblack hole entropy comes out right.\nNow we will try to describe this conformal ﬁeld theory a bit more explicitly. We start\nwith Q5 D5 branes, and we view the D1 branes as instantons of the low-energy SYM\ntheory on the ﬁve-branes [161]. These instantons live on M4 and are translationally\ninvariant (actually also SO(1, 1) invariant) along time and the x5 direction, where x5\nis the non compact direction along the D5 branes. See ﬁgure 5.2(a). This instanton\nconﬁguration, with instanton number Q1, has moduli, which are the parameters that\nparameterize a continuous family of solutions (classical instanton conﬁgurations). All\nof these solutions have the same energy. Small ﬂuctuations of this conﬁguration (at\nlow energies) are described by ﬂuctuations of the instanton moduli.\nThese moduli\ncan ﬂuctuate in time as well as in the x5 direction. See ﬁgure 5.2(b).

We will now explain qualitatively\nthis phase transition. Our discussion will be qualitative because we will work at the\norbifold point, and this is not correct if we are in the supergravity regime. We will\nsee that the symmetric product has a feature that makes this sharp phase transition\npossible.\nThe orbifold theory can be interpreted in terms of a gas of strings [466, 467]. These\nare strings that wind along x5 and move on M4. The total winding number is k. The\nstrings can be singly wound or multiply wound. In the R-R sector it does not cost any\nenergy to multiply wind the strings. If we have NS-NS boundary conditions, which\nare the appropriate ones to describe AdS3, it will cost some energy to multiply wind\nthe strings. The energy cost in the orbifold CFT is the same as twice the conformal\nweight of the corresponding twist operator, which is h = ¯h = w/4 + O(1/w) for a\nconﬁguration with winding number w.

In fact, it is equivalent to an SL(2, R) × SL(2, R) Chern-\nSimons theory [481, 482, 483, 484]. This gives rise to some physical degrees of freedom\nliving at the boundary. It was argued that we get a Liouville theory at the boundary\n[485, 486, 487, 488, 489], which includes a stress tensor operator. In the T 4 case we\nalso have some other special particles which correspond to fermion zero modes (1/2, 0)\nand (0, 1/2). These fermion zero modes are the supersymmetric partners of the U(1)\ncurrents associated to isometries of T 4. The six dimensional theory corresponding to\ntype IIB string theory on T 4 has 16 vector ﬁelds transforming in the spinor of SO(5, 5).\nFrom the symmetric product we get only 8 currents (4L + 4R). The other eight are\npresumably related to an extra copy of T 4 appearing in the CFT due to the Wilson\nlines of the U(1) in U(Q5) [460, 490].\nBesides these purely left-moving or purely right-moving modes, which are not so easy\nto see in supergravity, all other states arise as local bulk excitations of supergravity\nﬁelds on AdS3 and are clearly present.\nHigher values of j typically correspond to\nhigher Kaluza-Klein modes of lower j ﬁelds.\nMore precisely, we have n (1/2, 1/2)\nstates where n = h11 + 1 [278, 479, 447]. By applying Q’s, each of these states gives\nrise to four SU(2)-neutral scalar ﬁelds, which have conformal weights h = ¯h = 1.\nTherefore, they correspond to massless ﬁelds in spacetime by (3.14). These are the 4n\nmoduli of the supergravity compactiﬁcation, which are identiﬁed with the moduli of\nthe conformal ﬁeld theory. In the conformal ﬁeld theory 4h11 of them correspond to\ndeformations of each copy of M4 in the symmetric product, while the extra four are\nassociated to a blowup mode, the blowup mode of the Z2 singularity that arises when\nwe exchange two copies of M4. Next, we have n + 1 ﬁelds with quantum numbers\n(1, 1), n of these are higher order Kaluza Klein modes of the n ﬁelds we had before,\nand the new one corresponds to deformations of the S3. Each of these states gives rise\nto SU(2)-neutral ﬁelds with positive mass, since we have to apply Q’s twice and we get\nh = ¯h = 2. These are the n ﬁxed scalars of the supergravity background plus one more\nﬁeld related to changing the size of the S3. The ﬁelds with j,¯j’s above these values\nare just higher Kaluza Klein modes of the ﬁelds we have already mentioned explicitly.\nSee [278, 479, 447] for a more systematic treatment and derivation of these results.\nNow, we want to compare the supergravity result with the gauge theory results.\nIn (5.22) there is an “exclusion principle” since the total power of p has to be pk,\nthus limiting the total number of particles.

There are multi-particle states with\nj < k that are excluded from (5.22). The bounds from (5.22) appear for very large\nangular momenta and, therefore, very large energies, where we would not necessarily\ntrust the gravity approximation. In fact, the gravity result and the conformal ﬁeld\ntheory result match precisely, as long as the conformal weight or spin of the chiral\nprimaries is j,¯j ≤k/2. One can show that the gravity description exactly matches\nthe k →∞limit of (5.22) [447]. This limit is extracted from (5.22) by noticing that\nthere is a factor of (1−p) in the denominator, which is related to the identity operator.\nSo, we can extract the k →∞limit by multiplying (5.22) by (1 −p) and setting\np →1.\nIn principle, we could get precise agreement between the conformal ﬁeld\ntheory calculation and the supergravity calculation if we incorporate the exclusion\nprinciple by assigning a “degree” to each supergravity ﬁeld, as explained in [476],\nand then considering only multiparticle states with degree smaller than k. One can\nfurther wonder whether there is something special that happens at j = k/2, when the\nexclusion principle starts making a diﬀerence. Since we are considering states with\nhigh conformal weight and angular momentum it is natural to wonder whether there\nare any black hole states that could appear. There are black holes which carry angular\nmomentum on S3. These black holes are characterized by the two angular momenta\nJL, JR, of SU(2)L×SU(2)R. The minimum black hole mass for given angular momenta\nwas given in (5.17), Mmin(JL, JR) = k/2 + J2\nL/k + J2\nR/k, where we used c = 6k and\n(5.4). We see that these masses are always bigger than the mass of the chiral primary\nstates with angular momenta (JL, JR), except when JL = JR = k/2. So we see that\nsomething special is happening at j = k/2, since at this point a black hole appears\nas a chiral primary state. Connections between this exclusion principle and quantum\ngroups and non-commutative geometry were studied in [491, 492]."}

The six\ndimensional space-time theory has 5n massless scalar ﬁelds, which parameterize the\ncoset manifold SO(5, n)/SO(5) × SO(n) [494]. When we choose a particular charge\nvector, with q2 > 0, we break the duality group to SO(4, n), and out of the original 5n\nmassless scalars n becomes massive and have values determined by the charges (and\nthe other scalars) [495].

The advantage of this background is that one can solve\nstring theory on it to all orders in α′, since it is a WZW model, actually an SL(2, R) ×\nSU(2) WZW model. String propagation in SL(2, R) WZW models were studied in\n[496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513,\n514, 515, 516]. Thus, in this case we can also consider states corresponding to massive\nstring modes, etc. We can also deﬁne the spacetime Virasoro generators in the full\nstring theory, and check that they act on string states as they should [509, 510, 511]5. In\nthe string theory description the Virasoro symmetry appears directly in the formalism\nas a spacetime symmetry. One can also study D-branes in these AdS3 backgrounds\n[519]. Conditions for spacetime supersymmetry for string theory on SL(2, R) WZW\nbackgrounds were studied in [520, 521]. In the D1-D5 conﬁguration it is much harder\nto solve string theory, since RR backgrounds are involved. Classical actions for strings\non these backgrounds were written in [522, 523, 524]. However, a formulation of string\ntheory on these backgrounds was proposed in [525] (see also [526, 521, 527]).\nFor\nsome values of the moduli the CFT is singular. What this means is that we will have\na continuum of states in the cylinder picture. In the picture with NS charges this\nhappens, for example, when all RR B-ﬁelds on M4 are zero. This continuum of states\ncomes from fundamental strings stretching close to the boundary of AdS3. These states"}

It is also possible to obtain this geometry by considering\nthe near horizon behavior of a D1-D5 + KK monopole system, or equivalently a D1-D5\nsystem near an AN singularity. It is possible to analyze the ﬁeld theory by using the\nmethods in [344], and using the above anomaly argument one can calculate the right\nmoving central charge. The left moving central charge should be calculated by a more\ndetailed argument. When we have NS 5 branes and fundamental strings on an AN\nsingularity, the worldsheet theory is solvable, and one can calculate the spectrum of\nmassive string states, etc. [528]. One can also consider also both RR and NS ﬂuxes\nsimultaneously [529]. Other papers analyzing aspects of these quotients or orbifolds\nare [530, 530, 531, 532, 533].\nA related conﬁguration arises if we consider M-theory on M6, where M6 = T 6, T 2 ×\nK3 or CY3, and we wrap M5 branes on a four-cycle in M6 with non-vanishing triple\nself-intersection number. Then, we get a string in ﬁve dimensions, and the near horizon\ngeometry of the supergravity solution is AdS3 × S2 × M6\nf , where the subscript on M6\nf\nindicates that the vector moduli of M6 are ﬁxed scalars. In this case we get again\nan N = (0, 4) theory, and the SU(2)R symmetry is associated to rotations of the\nsphere. It is possible to calculate the central charge by counting the number of moduli\nof the brane conﬁguration. Some of the moduli correspond to geometric deformations\nand some of them correspond to B-ﬁelds on the ﬁvebrane worldvolume [534, 535]. A\nsupergravity analysis of this compactiﬁcation was done in [447, 536].\nAnother interesting case is string theory compactiﬁed on AdS3 ×S3 ×S3 ×S1, which\nhas a large N = 4 symmetry [537, 538, 539]. This algebra is sometimes called Aγ. It\nincludes an SU(2)k × SU(2)k′ × U(1) current algebra. The relative sizes of the levels\nof the two SU(2) factors are related to the relative sizes of the radii of the spheres.\nThis case seems to be conceptually simpler than the case with an M4, since all the\nspacetime dimensions are associated to a symmetry of the system6. In [537] a geometry\nlike this was obtained from branes, except that the S1 was replaced by R, and it is not\nclear which brane conﬁguration gives the geometry with the S1. This makes it more\ndiﬃcult to guess the dual conformal ﬁeld theory. In [538] a CFT dual was proposed\nfor this system in the case that k = k′. One starts with a theory with a free boson and\nfour free fermions, which has large N = 4 symmetry. Let us call this theory CFT3.\nThen, we can consider the theory based on the symmetric product Sym(CFT3)k. The"}

In [539] a dual CFT was proposed for the general\ncase (k ̸= k′).\nAnother interesting example is the D1-D5 brane system in Type I string theory\n[540, 541, 542]. The N = (0, 4) theory on the D1 brane worldvolume theory encodes\nin the Yukawa couplings the ADHM data for the construction of the moduli space of\ninstantons [543, 544]. What distinguishes the Type I system from the Type IIB case is\nthe SO(32) gauge group in the open string sector. When the D5 branes wrap a compact\nspace M4 with M4 = T 4, K3, the near horizon geometry of the Type I supergravity\nsolution is AdS3×S3×M4 [542]. As in the previous examples, one is lead to conjecture\na duality between Type I string theory on AdS3 × S3 × M4 and the two-dimensional\n(0, 4) SCFT in the IR limit of the D1 brane worldvolume theory. The supergroup of\nthe Type I compactiﬁcation is SU(1, 1|2) × SL(2, R) × SU(2), and the Kaluza-Klein\nspectrum in the supergravity can be analyzed as in [447].

In higher dimensions this is not possible since pure gravity is not renormal-\nizable, so the only known sensible quantum gravity theory is string theory, but in\nthree dimensions gravity can be rewritten as a Chern-Simons theory [483, 484], and\nthis theory is renormalizable. Gravity in three dimensions has no dynamical degrees\nof freedom.\nWe have seen, nevertheless, that it has black hole solutions when we\nconsider gravity with a negative cosmological constant [442] (5.8). So, it should at\nleast describe the dynamics of these black holes, black hole collisions, etc. It has been\nargued that this Chern-Simons theory reduces to a Liouville theory at the boundary\n[485, 487, 488, 546], with the right central charge (5.4). Naively, using the Cardy for-\nmula, this Liouville theory does not seem to give the same entropy as the black holes,\nbut the Cardy formula does not hold in this case (Liouville theory does not satisfy the\nassumptions that go into the Cardy formula). Hopefully, these problems will be solved\nonce it is understood how to properly quantize Liouville theory. Since we have the\nright central charge it seems that we should be able to calculate the BTZ black hole\nentropy [446], but Liouville theory is very peculiar and the entropy seems smaller [547].\nOther papers studying AdS pure gravity or BTZ black holes in pure gravity include\n[548, 286, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564,"}

The average over initial states is\nessentially an average over a thermal ensemble, since the number of states is very large\nso the microcanonical ensemble is the same as a thermal ensemble. So, the ﬁnal result\nis that we have to compute the two point function of the corresponding operator over a\nthermal ensemble. This essentially translates into computing the correlation function\non the Euclidean cylinder, and the result is proportional to (5.40) [16, 575, 574]. This\nargument reproduces the functional dependence on ω of (5.40). For other ﬁelds (non-\nminimally coupled) the functional dependence on ω is determined just in terms of the\nconformal weight of the associated operator.\nLet us emphasize that the matching procedure (5.38) is valid only in the low energy\nregime (5.36). In this regime the typical gravitational size of the conﬁguration, which\nis of order r5, is much smaller than the Compton wavelength of the particle. See ﬁgure\n1.4. In fact, note that in the connecting region r ∼r5 the function φ does not vary very\nmuch. Let us see this more explicitly. We see from (5.37) that we can approximate the\nequation by something like ω2r2\n5φ + φ′′ = 0. From (5.36) we see that the variation of φ\nis very small over this connecting region. Furthermore, since absorption will turn out\nto be small, we can approximate the value of φ at the origin by the value it has in ﬂat\nspace. So, we can directly match the values of φ at the origin for a wave propagating\nin ﬂat space with the value of φ near the boundary of AdS3."}

The factor of\nQ1Q5 comes from the fact that we have Q1Q5 D1 branes.

As we\nremarked before, the thermal-looking factors in (5.40) can be derived just by doing a\ncalculation of the two point function on the cylinder [574]. Finally, we should remark\nthat this calculation implies that the metric on the moduli space of the CFT has\nan overall factor of k = Q1Q5 as compared with the metric that appears in the six\ndimensional gravity action (5.43). This blends in perfectly with the expectations from\nAdS3/CFT2, since in the AdS3 region, by the time we go down to three dimensions, we\nget factors of the volume of the S3 and the radius of AdS3 which produce the correct\nfactor of k in the gravity answer for the metric on the moduli space.\nOf course, this absorption cross section calculation is also related to the time reversed\nprocess of Hawking emission.

This identiﬁcation projects out half of the Kaluza-Klein spectrum and only the\neven k harmonics remain.

The dimension of this operator\nis ∆= 2N.\nTo leading order in 1/N the correlation functions of the other chiral\noperators are similar to those of the AN−1 SCFT. The DN theories also have a DLCQ\nMatrix description as quantum mechanics on the moduli space of DN instantons [601].\nThis moduli space is singular. One would expect to associate the spectrum of chiral\nprimary operators with the cohomology with compact support of some resolution of\nthis space, but such a resolution has not been constructed yet.\nA diﬀerent example is the (1, 0) six dimensional SCFT with E8 global symmetry,\nwhich is realized on the worldvolume of M5 branes placed on top of the nine brane in\nthe Hoˇrava-Witten [609] compactiﬁcation of M theory on R10×S1/Z2. The conjectured\ndual description is in terms of M theory on AdS7 × S4/Z2 [610]. The Z2 action has a\nﬁxed locus AdS7×S3 on which a ten dimensional N = 1 E8 vector multiplet propagates.\nThe chiral operators fall into short representations of the supergroup OSp(6, 2|2). In\n[611] E8 neutral and charged operators of the (1, 0) theory were matched with Kaluza-\nKlein modes of bulk ﬁelds and ﬁelds living on the singular locus, respectively.\nCorrelation functions of chiral primary operators of the large N (2, 0) theory can\nbe computed by solving classical diﬀerential equations for the supergravity ﬁelds that\ncorrespond to the ﬁeld theory operators. Two and three point functions of the chiral\nprimary operators have been computed in [612].\nThe (2, 0) SCFT has Wilson surface observables [613], which are generalizations\nof the operator given by W(Σ) = exp(i\nR\nΣ Bµνdσµν) in the theory of a free tensor\nmultiplet, where Σ is a two dimensional surface. A prescription for computing the\nWilson surface in the dual M theory picture has been given in [294].\nIt amounts,\nin the supergravity approximation, to the computation of the minimal volume of a\nmembrane bounded at the boundary of AdS7 by Σ. The reasoning is analogous to that\ndiscussed in section 3.5, but here instead of the strings stretched between D-branes,\nM2 branes are stretched between M5 branes. Such an M2 brane behaves as a string on\nthe M5 branes worldvolume, with a tension proportional to the distance between the\nM5 branes. By separating one M5 brane from N M5 branes this string can be used\nas a probe of the SCFT on the worldvolume of the N M5 branes, analogous to the\nexternal quarks discussed in section 3.5. If we consider two such parallel strings with\nlength l and distance L and of opposite orientation, the resulting potential per unit\nlength is [294]\nV"}

The procedure for Wilson surface computations has been applied\nalso to the computation of the operator product expansion of Wilson surfaces, and the\nextraction of the OPE coeﬃcients of the chiral primary operators [612].\nThe six dimensional AN−1 theory can be wrapped on various two dimensional mani-\nfolds. At energies lower than the inverse size of the manifolds, the low-energy eﬀective\ndescription is in terms of four dimensional SU(N) gauge theories. The two dimensional\nmanifold and its embedding in eleven dimensions determine the amount of supersym-\nmetry of the gauge theory. The simplest case is a wrapping on T 2 which preserves all the\nsupersymmetry. This results in the N = 4 SU(N) SCFT, with the complex gauge cou-\npling being the complex structure τ of the torus. In general, when the two dimensional\nmanifold is a holomorphic curve (Riemann surface), called a supersymmetric cycle, the\nfour dimensional theory is supersymmetric. For N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theo-\nries the Riemann surface is the Seiberg-Witten curve and its period matrix gives the\nlow energy holomorphic gauge couplings τij (i, j = 1, · · · , N −1) [614, 615, 616, 353].\nFor N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories the Riemann surface has genus zero and it\nencodes holomorphic properties of the supersymmetric gauge theory, namely the struc-\nture of its moduli space of vacua [617]. For a generic real two dimensional manifold\nthe four dimensional theory is not supersymmetric. Some qualitative properties of the\nQCD string [618] and the θ vacua follow from the wrapping procedure. Of course,\nin the non-supersymmetric cases the subtle issue of stability has to be addressed as\ndiscussed in section 4.1. In general it is not known how to compute the near-horizon\nlimit of 5-branes wrapped on a general manifold. At any rate, it seems that the theory\non M5 branes is very relevant to the study of four dimensional gauge theories. The\nM5 branes theory will be one starting point for an approach to studying pure QCD in\nsection 6.2.\nOther works on M5 branes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence are [619,\n620, 621, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627, 628, 629, 630]."}

If we place the M2 branes at the origin of R3×R8/Γ with Γ a discrete subgroup\nof the SO(8) R-symmetry group, we get AdS4×S7/Γ as the near horizon geometry. One\nclass of models is when Γ ⊂SU(2)×SU(2) is a cyclic group. It is generated by multiply-\ning the complex coordinates z1,2,3,4 of C4 ≃R8 by diag(e2πi/k, e−2πi/k, e2πia/k, e−2πia/k)\nfor relatively prime integers a, k.

Of particular interest are non supersymmetric gauge theories that exhibit\nasymptotic freedom and conﬁnement. In this section, we will discuss an approach to\nstudying pure (without matter ﬁelds) QCDp in p dimensions using a dual superstring\ndescription. We will be discussing mainly the cases p = 3, 4.\nThe approach proposed by Witten [185] was to start with a maximally supersym-\nmetric gauge theory on the p + 1 dimensional worldvolume of N Dp branes. One then\ncompactiﬁes the supersymmetric theory on a circle of radius R0 and imposes anti-\nperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions around the circle. Since the fermions do\nnot have zero frequency modes around the circle they acquire a mass mf ∼1/R0. The\nscalars then acquire a mass from loop diagrams, and at energies much below 1/R0 they\ndecouple from the system. The expected eﬀective theory at large distances compared\nto the radius of the circle is pure QCD in p dimensions. Note that a similar approach\nwas discussed in the treatment of gauge theories at ﬁnite temperature T in section\n3.6, where the radius of the circle is proportional to 1/T. The high temperature limit\nof the supersymmetric gauge theory in p + 1 dimensions is thus described by a non\nsupersymmetric gauge theory in p dimensions.\nThe main obstacle to the analysis is clear from the discussions of the duality between\nstring theory and quantum ﬁeld theories in the previous sections. The string approach\nto weakly coupled gauge theories is not yet developed. Most of the available tools\nare applicable in the supergravity limit that describes the gauge theory with a large\nnumber of colors and large ’t Hooft parameter. In this regime we cannot really learn\ndirectly about QCD, since the typical scale of candidate QCD states (glueballs) is\nof the same order of magnitude (for QCD4, or a larger scale for QCD3) as the scale\n1/R0 of the mass of the “extra” scalars and fermions.\nA related issue is that at\nshort distances asymptotically free gauge theories are weakly coupled and the dual\nsupergravity description is not valid. Therefore, we will be limited to a discussion in\nthe strong coupling region of the gauge theories and in particular we will not be able\nto exhibit asymptotic freedom."}

However, there is also a possibility that the gauge description is valid for weak\ncoupling and the string theory description is valid for strong coupling with no smooth\ncrossover between the two descriptions. In such a scenario there is a phase transition\nat λ = λc [315, 316]. This will prevent us from using the string description to study\nQCD, and will prevent classical string theory from being the master ﬁeld for large N\nQCD.\nIn the last part of this section we will brieﬂy discuss another approach, based on a\nsuggestion by Polyakov [48], to study non supersymmetric gauge theories via a non su-\npersymmetric string description.

Indeed, it has been found\nthere that it exhibits a Coulomb like behavior. The basic reason was that when we\nscaled up the loop C by xi →αxi with a positive number α, we could use conformal\ninvariance to scale up D without changing its (regularized) area. Therefore D was not\nproportional to A(C). When scaling up the loop the surface D bends in the interior of\nthe AdS space. In the case when such a bending is limited by the range of the radial\ncoordinate one gets an area law. This is the case in the models at hand, in which the\ncoordinate u in (6.22) is bounded from below by u0 as in ﬁgure 6.3.\nThe evaluation of the classical action of the string worldsheet bounded by the loop C\nat inﬁnite u is straightforward, as done in section 3.5 [327, 665]. The string minimizes\nits length by going to the region with the smallest possible metric component gii (where\ni labels the R3 directions), from which it gets the contribution to the string tension.\nThe smallest value of gii in the metric (6.22) is at the horizon.

These last two solutions are possible only when the fermions have\nantiperiodic boundary conditions on the corresponding circles.

In any case, for very low and very high\ntemperatures they are expected to be the dominant conﬁgurations (see [663])5. The\nentropy of the the high temperature phase is of order N2, while the entropy of the low\ntemperature phase is essentially zero since the number of states in the gravity picture\nis independent of the Newton constant.\nIf we compute the potential between a quark and an antiquark then in the low\ntemperature phase it grows linearly, so that we have conﬁnement, while in the high\ntemperature phase the strings coming from the external quarks can end on the horizon,\nso that the potential vanishes beyond a certain separation. Thus, this is a conﬁnement-\ndeconﬁnement transition. It might seem a bit surprising at ﬁrst sight that essentially\nthe same solution can be interpreted as a conﬁned and a deconﬁned phase at the same\ntime.\nThe point it that quark worldlines are timelike, therefore they select one of\nthe two circles, and the physical properties depend crucially on whether this circle is\ncontractible or not in the full ten-dimensional geometry."}

One can add to the lattice action deformations which\nare irrelevant in the continuum limit and arrive at an appropriate eﬀective description\nof the continuum theory while having a larger lattice spacing. Such actions are called\nimproved actions.\nA similar strategy in the dual supergravity description amounts to a modiﬁcation of\nthe background metric. The requirement is that the modiﬁcation will better capture the\neﬀective description of the gauge theory while still having a ﬁnite cutoﬀ(corresponding\nto ﬁnite λ in our case). On the lattice a criterion for improvement is Lorentz invariance.\nHere, since the cutoﬀis provided by a higher dimensional theory we have the full\nLorentz invariance in any case. The improvement will be measured by the removal\nof the Kaluza-Klein modes. Note that we are attempting at an improvement in the\nstrong coupling regime.

The deformation\nof the background is parametrized by the angular momentum parameter.\nKaluza-\nKlein modes associated with the circle have the form Φ = f(u)eikxeinτ, n > 0.

As in the Type II case, we can consider the gauge\ntheories on the worldvolume of N such branes. These theories do not contain an open\nstring tachyon. Moreover, the usual condensation of the tachyon could be avoided in\nthe near horizon region as we explain below.\nOne particular example studied in [701] is the theory on N ﬂat D3 branes in Type\n0B theory. Since there is a doubled set of RR 4-form ﬁelds in Type 0B string theory,\nthe D3 branes can carry two charges, electric and magnetic. The worldvolume theory\ntheory of N ﬂat electric D3 branes is a U(N) gauge theory with six scalars in the\nadjoint representation of the gauge group. There are no fermionic ﬁelds. The classical\naction is derived by a dimensional reduction of the pure SU(N) gauge theory action\nin ten dimensions. The six scalars are the components of the gauge ﬁelds in the re-\nduced dimensions. The classical theory has an SO(6) global symmetry that rotates\nthe six scalars.\nThis allows several possible parameters (from the point of view of\nrenormalizable ﬁeld theory) : a gauge coupling gY M, a mass parameter for the scalars\nm and various scalar quartic potential couplings gi, one of which appears in the clas-\nsical Lagrangian. In the classical worldvolume action, the mass parameter is zero and\nthe gi are ﬁxed in terms of gY M, it is just the dimensional reduction of the ten dimen-\nsional bosonic Yang-Mills theory. Quantum mechanically, the parameters are corrected\ndiﬀerently and can take independent values. The theory has a phase diagram depend-\ning on these parameters. Generically we expect to see in the diagram Coulomb-like\n(Higgs) phases, conﬁnement phases and maybe non trivial RG ﬁxed points arising from\nparticular tunings of the parameters.\nAs in the case of D branes in Type II theories, one can conjecture here that the\nlow-energy theory on the electric D3 branes has a dual non supersymmetric string\ndescription. At ﬁrst sight this should involve a solution of AdS5 × S5 type. The closed\nstring tachyon might be allowed in AdS if the curvature is of the order of the string\nscale, since in that case the tachyon would obey the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound\n(2.42). The fact that the curvatures are of the order of the string scale renders the\ngravity analysis invalid. In principle we should solve the worldsheet string theory. Since\nwe do not know how to do that at present we can just do a gravity analysis and hope\nthat the full string theory analysis will give similar results.

Moreover, these\nstrings move in higher dimensions, as was argued in [47].\nThese extra dimensions\narise dynamically in the gauge theory. For some ﬁeld theories the curvatures in the\nhigher dimensional space could be small. The prototypical example is N = 4 super-\nYang-Mills with large N, g2\nY MN.

Whether it also has a gravity description depends on how large the curvatures\nin this string theory are. If the curvatures are small, we can have an approximate\nclassical gravity description. Otherwise, we should consider all string modes on the\nsame footing. This involves solving the worldsheet theories for strings in Ramond-\nRamond backgrounds. This is a problem that only now is beginning to be elucidated\n[525, 714, 715, 716, 717, 718, 719, 720, 721]. For non-supersymmetric QCD, or other\ntheories which are weakly coupled (as QCD is at high energies), we expect to have\ncurvatures at least of the order of the string scale, so that a proper understanding of\nstrings on highly curved spaces seems crucial.\nIt is also possible to deform the N = 4 ﬁeld theory, breaking supersymmetry and\nconformal invariance, by giving a mass to the fermions or by compactifying the theory\non a circle with supersymmetry breaking boundary conditions.

However, in the\nregime where the analysis can be done (small curvature) this theory includes many\nadditional degrees of freedom beyond those in the standard bosonic Yang-Mills the-\nory. In order to do quantitative calculations in bosonic Yang-Mills one would have to\ndo calculations when the curvatures are large, which goes beyond the gravity approx-\nimation and requires understanding the propagation of strings in Ramond-Ramond\nbackgrounds.

This also implies that gravity in these spaces is\nunitary, giving the ﬁrst explicit non-perturbative construction of a unitary theory of\nquantum gravity,1 albeit in a curved space background. Black holes are some mixed\nstates in the ﬁeld theory Hilbert space. Explicit microscopic calculations of black hole\nentropy and greybody factors can be done in the AdS3 case (chapter 5).\nBasic properties of quantum gravity, such as approximate causality and locality at\nlow energies, are far from clear in this description [181, 279, 171, 179, 177, 731, 182],\nand it would be interesting to understand them better. We are also still far from having\na precise mapping between general conﬁgurations in the gravitational theory and in\nthe ﬁeld theory (see [732, 178] for some attempts to go in this direction).\nIn principle one can extract the physics of quantum gravity in ﬂat space by taking\nthe large radius limit of physics in AdS space. Since we have not discussed this yet"}

We would like to be able to describe processes in ﬂat space which\noccur, for instance, at some ﬁxed string coupling, with the energies and the size of the\ninteraction region kept ﬁxed in string (or Planck) units. Computations on AdS space\nare necessarily done with some ﬁnite radius of curvature; however, we can view this\nradius of curvature as a regulator, and take it to inﬁnity at the end of any calculation,\nin such a way that the local physics remains the same. Let us discuss what this means\nfor the AdS5 × S5 case (the discussion is similar for other cases). We need to keep the\nstring coupling ﬁxed, and take N →∞since the radius of curvature in Planck units is\nproportional to N1/4. Note that this is diﬀerent from the ’t Hooft limit, and involves\ntaking λ →∞. In order to describe a scattering process in space-time which has ﬁnite\nenergies in this limit, it turns out that the energies in the ﬁeld theory must scale as\nN1/4 (measured in units of the scale of the S3 which the ﬁeld theory is compactiﬁed\non; we need to work in global AdS coordinates to describe ﬂat-space scattering). In\nthis limit the ﬁeld theory is very strongly coupled and the energies are also very high,\nand there are no known ways to do any computations on the ﬁeld theory side.\nIt\nwould be interesting to compute anything explicitly in this limit.\nFor example, it\nwould be interesting to compute the entropy of a small Schwarzschild black hole, much\nsmaller than the radius of AdS, to see ﬂat-space Hawking radiation, and so on. If we\nstart with AdS5 × S5 this limit gives us the physics in ﬂat ten dimensional space, and\nsimilarly starting with AdS4 × S7 or AdS7 × S4 we can get the physics in ﬂat eleven\ndimensional space. It would be interesting to understand how the correspondence can\nbe used to learn about theories with lower dimension, where some of the dimensions\nare compactiﬁed. A limit of string theory on AdS3 × S3 × M4 may be used to give\nstring theory on R5,1 × M4, but it is not clear how to get four dimensional physics out\nof the correspondence.\nOne could, in principle, get four dimensional ﬂat space by starting from AdS2 × S2"}

AdS2 spaces arise as the near horizon geometry of extremal charged\nReissner-Nordstrom black holes. Even though ﬁelds propagating in AdS2 behave sim-\nilarly to the higher dimensional cases [739], the problem is that any ﬁnite energy\nexcitation seems to destroy the AdS2 boundary conditions [342]. This is related to\nthe fact that black holes (as opposed to black p-branes, p > 0) have an energy gap\n(see section 5.7), so that in the extreme low energy limit we seem to have no exci-\ntations. One possibility is that the correspondence works only for the ground states.\nEven then, there are instantons that can lead to a fragmentation of the spacetime into\nseveral pieces [740]. Some conformal quantum mechanics systems that are, or could\nbe, related to AdS2 were studied in [741, 742, 743, 729]. Aspects of Hawking radiation\nin AdS2 were studied in [744]."}

It would be interesting to understand how the correspondence works when\nthe boundary is light-like, as in Minkowski space. It seems that holography must work\nquite diﬀerently in these cases (see [745, 746] for discussions of some of the issues in-\nvolved). In the cases we understand, the asymptotic space close to the boundary has\na well deﬁned notion of time, which is the one that is associated to the gauge the-\nory. It would be interesting to understand how holography works in other spacetimes,\nwhere we do not have this notion of time. Interesting examples are spatially closed\nuniverses, expanding universes, de-Sitter spacetimes, etc. See [747, 748, 749, 750] for\nsome attempts in this direction. The precise meaning of holography in the cosmological\ncontext is still not clear [751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, 757].\nTo summarize, the past 18 months have seen much progress in our understanding of\nstring/M theory compactiﬁcations on AdS and related spaces, and in our understand-\ning of large N ﬁeld theories. However, the correspondence is still far from realizing the\nhopes that it initially raised, and much work still remains to be done. The correspon-\ndence gives us implicit ways to describe QCD and related interesting ﬁeld theories in\na dual “stringy” description, but so far we are unable to do any explicit computations\nin the ﬁeld theories that we are really interested in. The main hope for progress in\nthis direction lies in a better understanding of string theory in RR backgrounds. The\ncorrespondence also gives us an explicit example of a unitary and holographic theory\nof quantum gravity. We hope this example can be used to better understand quan-\ntum gravity in ﬂat space, where the issues of unitarity (the “information problem”)\nand holography are still quite obscure. Even better, one could hope that the corre-\nspondence would hint at a way to formulate string/M theory independently of the\nbackground. These questions will apparently have to wait until the next millennium."}
