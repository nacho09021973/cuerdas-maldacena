All particles are excitations of some ﬁeld. These\nparticles are pointlike and they interact locally with other particles.\nEven though\nquantum ﬁeld theories describe nature at the distance scales we observe, there are\nstrong indications that new elements will be involved at very short distances (or very\nhigh energies), distances of the order of the Planck scale. The reason is that at those\ndistances (or energies) quantum gravity eﬀects become important. It has not been\npossible to quantize gravity following the usual perturbative methods. Nevertheless,\none can incorporate quantum gravity in a consistent quantum theory by giving up the\nnotion that particles are pointlike and assuming that the fundamental objects in the\ntheory are strings, namely one-dimensional extended objects [1, 2]. These strings can\noscillate, and there is a spectrum of energies, or masses, for these oscillating strings.\nThe oscillating strings look like localized, particle-like excitations to a low energy ob-\nserver. So, a single oscillating string can eﬀectively give rise to many types of particles,\ndepending on its state of oscillation. All string theories include a particle with zero\nmass and spin two. Strings can interact by splitting and joining interactions. The only\nconsistent interaction for massless spin two particles is that of gravity. Therefore, any\nstring theory will contain gravity. The structure of string theory is highly constrained.\nString theories do not make sense in an arbitrary number of dimensions or on any\narbitrary geometry. Flat space string theory exists (at least in perturbation theory)\nonly in ten dimensions. Actually, 10-dimensional string theory is described by a string\nwhich also has fermionic excitations and gives rise to a supersymmetric theory.1 String\ntheory is then a candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. One can get down to four\n1One could consider a string with no fermionic excitations, the so called “bosonic” string. It lives\nin 26 dimensions and contains tachyons, signaling an instability of the theory.\n4\n"}

Then, low energy interactions are determined by the geometry of\nM6.\nEven though this is the motivation usually given for string theory nowadays, it is\nnot how string theory was originally discovered. String theory was discovered in an\nattempt to describe the large number of mesons and hadrons that were experimentally\ndiscovered in the 1960’s. The idea was to view all these particles as diﬀerent oscillation\nmodes of a string. The string idea described well some features of the hadron spectrum.\nFor example, the mass of the lightest hadron with a given spin obeys a relation like\nm2 ∼TJ2 + const. This is explained simply by assuming that the mass and angular\nmomentum come from a rotating, relativistic string of tension T. It was later discovered\nthat hadrons and mesons are actually made of quarks and that they are described by\nQCD.\nQCD is a gauge theory based on the group SU(3). This is sometimes stated by saying\nthat quarks have three colors. QCD is asymptotically free, meaning that the eﬀective\ncoupling constant decreases as the energy increases. At low energies QCD becomes\nstrongly coupled and it is not easy to perform calculations. One possible approach\nis to use numerical simulations on the lattice. This is at present the best available\ntool to do calculations in QCD at low energies. It was suggested by ’t Hooft that the\ntheory might simplify when the number of colors N is large [3]. The hope was that one\ncould solve exactly the theory with N = ∞, and then one could do an expansion in\n1/N = 1/3. Furthermore, as explained in the next section, the diagrammatic expansion\nof the ﬁeld theory suggests that the large N theory is a free string theory and that\nthe string coupling constant is 1/N. If the case with N = 3 is similar to the case\nwith N = ∞then this explains why the string model gave the correct relation between\nthe mass and the angular momentum. In this way the large N limit connects gauge\ntheories with string theories. The ’t Hooft argument, reviewed below, is very general,\nso it suggests that diﬀerent kinds of gauge theories will correspond to diﬀerent string\ntheories. In this review we will study this correspondence between string theories and\nthe large N limit of ﬁeld theories. We will see that the strings arising in the large N\nlimit of ﬁeld theories are the same as the strings describing quantum gravity. Namely,\nstring theory in some backgrounds, including quantum gravity, is equivalent (dual) to\na ﬁeld theory.\nWe said above that strings are not consistent in four ﬂat dimensions. Indeed, if one\nwants to quantize a four dimensional string theory an anomaly appears that forces the\nintroduction of an extra ﬁeld, sometimes called the “Liouville” ﬁeld [4]. This ﬁeld on\nthe string worldsheet may be interpreted as an extra dimension, so that the strings\neﬀectively move in ﬁve dimensions. One might qualitatively think of this new ﬁeld as\nthe “thickness” of the string. If this is the case, why do we say that the string moves\n5\n"}

The reason is that, like any string theory, this theory will contain\ngravity, and the gravitational theory will live in as many dimensions as the number of\nﬁelds we have on the string. It is crucial then that the ﬁve dimensional geometry is\ncurved, so that it can correspond to a four dimensional ﬁeld theory, as described in\ndetail below.\nThe argument that gauge theories are related to string theories in the large N limit\nis very general and is valid for basically any gauge theory.\nIn particular we could\nconsider a gauge theory where the coupling does not run (as a function of the energy\nscale). Then, the theory is conformally invariant. It is quite hard to ﬁnd quantum ﬁeld\ntheories that are conformally invariant. In supersymmetric theories it is sometimes\npossible to prove exact conformal invariance. A simple example, which will be the\nmain example in this review, is the supersymmetric SU(N) (or U(N)) gauge theory in\nfour dimensions with four spinor supercharges (N = 4). Four is the maximal possible\nnumber of supercharges for a ﬁeld theory in four dimensions. Besides the gauge ﬁelds\n(gluons) this theory contains also four fermions and six scalar ﬁelds in the adjoint\nrepresentation of the gauge group.\nThe Lagrangian of such theories is completely\ndetermined by supersymmetry. There is a global SU(4) R-symmetry that rotates the\nsix scalar ﬁelds and the four fermions.\nThe conformal group in four dimensions is\nSO(4, 2), including the usual Poincar´e transformations as well as scale transformations\nand special conformal transformations (which include the inversion symmetry xµ →\nxµ/x2). These symmetries of the ﬁeld theory should be reﬂected in the dual string\ntheory. The simplest way for this to happen is if the ﬁve dimensional geometry has these\nsymmetries. Locally there is only one space with SO(4, 2) isometries: ﬁve dimensional\nAnti-de-Sitter space, or AdS5. Anti-de Sitter space is the maximally symmetric solution\nof Einstein’s equations with a negative cosmological constant. In this supersymmetric\ncase we expect the strings to also be supersymmetric. We said that superstrings move\nin ten dimensions. Now that we have added one more dimension it is not surprising any\nmore to add ﬁve more to get to a ten dimensional space. Since the gauge theory has\nan SU(4) ≃SO(6) global symmetry it is rather natural that the extra ﬁve dimensional\nspace should be a ﬁve sphere, S5. So, we conclude that N = 4 U(N) Yang-Mills theory\ncould be the same as ten dimensional superstring theory on AdS5 × S5 [5]. Here we\nhave presented a very heuristic argument for this equivalence; later we will be more\nprecise and give more evidence for this correspondence.\nThe relationship we described between gauge theories and string theory on Anti-de-\nSitter spaces was motivated by studies of D-branes and black holes in strings theory.\nD-branes are solitons in string theory [6]. They come in various dimensionalities. If\nthey have zero spatial dimensions they are like ordinary localized, particle-type soliton\nsolutions, analogous to the ’t Hooft-Polyakov [7, 8] monopole in gauge theories. These\nare called D-zero-branes. If they have one extended dimension they are called D-one-\n6\n"}

They are much heavier than ordinary fundamental strings when\nthe string coupling is small. In fact, the tension of all D-branes is proportional to 1/gs,\nwhere gs is the string coupling constant. D-branes are deﬁned in string perturbation\ntheory in a very simple way: they are surfaces where open strings can end. These\nopen strings have some massless modes, which describe the oscillations of the branes,\na gauge ﬁeld living on the brane, and their fermionic partners. If we have N coincident\nbranes the open strings can start and end on diﬀerent branes, so they carry two indices\nthat run from one to N. This in turn implies that the low energy dynamics is described\nby a U(N) gauge theory. D-p-branes are charged under p + 1-form gauge potentials,\nin the same way that a 0-brane (particle) can be charged under a one-form gauge\npotential (as in electromagnetism). These p + 1-form gauge potentials have p + 2-form\nﬁeld strengths, and they are part of the massless closed string modes, which belong to\nthe supergravity (SUGRA) multiplet containing the massless ﬁelds in ﬂat space string\ntheory (before we put in any D-branes). If we now add D-branes they generate a ﬂux of\nthe corresponding ﬁeld strength, and this ﬂux in turn contributes to the stress energy\ntensor so the geometry becomes curved. Indeed it is possible to ﬁnd solutions of the\nsupergravity equations carrying these ﬂuxes. Supergravity is the low-energy limit of\nstring theory, and it is believed that these solutions may be extended to solutions of\nthe full string theory. These solutions are very similar to extremal charged black hole\nsolutions in general relativity, except that in this case they are black branes with p\nextended spatial dimensions. Like black holes they contain event horizons.\nIf we consider a set of N coincident D-3-branes the near horizon geometry turns out\nto be AdS5 ×S5. On the other hand, the low energy dynamics on their worldvolume is\ngoverned by a U(N) gauge theory with N = 4 supersymmetry [9]. These two pictures of\nD-branes are perturbatively valid for diﬀerent regimes in the space of possible coupling\nconstants. Perturbative ﬁeld theory is valid when gsN is small, while the low-energy\ngravitational description is perturbatively valid when the radius of curvature is much\nlarger than the string scale, which turns out to imply that gsN should be very large. As\nan object is brought closer and closer to the black brane horizon its energy measured\nby an outside observer is redshifted, due to the large gravitational potential, and the\nenergy seems to be very small.\nOn the other hand low energy excitations on the\nbranes are governed by the Yang-Mills theory. So, it becomes natural to conjecture\nthat Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling is describing the near horizon region of\nthe black brane, whose geometry is AdS5 × S5. The ﬁrst indications that this is the\ncase came from calculations of low energy graviton absorption cross sections [10, 11,\n12]. It was noticed there that the calculation done using gravity and the calculation\ndone using super Yang-Mills theory agreed. These calculations, in turn, were inspired\nby similar calculations for coincident D1-D5 branes.\nIn this case the near horizon\ngeometry involves AdS3 × S3 and the low energy ﬁeld theory living on the D-branes\n7\n"}

In this D1-D5 case there were numerous\ncalculations that agreed between the ﬁeld theory and gravity. First black hole entropy\nfor extremal black holes was calculated in terms of the ﬁeld theory in [13], and then\nagreement was shown for near extremal black holes [14, 15] and for absorption cross\nsections [16, 17, 18]. More generally, we will see that correlation functions in the gauge\ntheory can be calculated using the string theory (or gravity for large gsN) description,\nby considering the propagation of particles between diﬀerent points in the boundary\nof AdS, the points where operators are inserted [19, 20].\nSupergravities on AdS spaces were studied very extensively, see [21, 22] for reviews.\nSee also [23, 24] for earlier hints of the correspondence.\nOne of the main points of this review will be that the strings coming from gauge\ntheories are very much like the ordinary superstrings that have been studied during the\nlast 20 years. The only particular feature is that they are moving on a curved geometry\n(anti-de Sitter space) which has a boundary at spatial inﬁnity. The boundary is at an\ninﬁnite spatial distance, but a light ray can go to the boundary and come back in ﬁnite\ntime. Massive particles can never get to the boundary. The radius of curvature of\nAnti-de Sitter space depends on N so that large N corresponds to a large radius of\ncurvature. Thus, by taking N to be large we can make the curvature as small as we\nwant. The theory in AdS includes gravity, since any string theory includes gravity. So\nin the end we claim that there is an equivalence between a gravitational theory and a\nﬁeld theory. However, the mapping between the gravitational and ﬁeld theory degrees\nof freedom is quite non-trivial since the ﬁeld theory lives in a lower dimension. In some\nsense the ﬁeld theory (or at least the set of local observables in the ﬁeld theory) lives\non the boundary of spacetime. One could argue that in general any quantum gravity\ntheory in AdS deﬁnes a conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT) “on the boundary”. In some\nsense the situation is similar to the correspondence between three dimensional Chern-\nSimons theory and a WZW model on the boundary [25]. This is a topological theory in\nthree dimensions that induces a normal (non-topological) ﬁeld theory on the boundary.\nA theory which includes gravity is in some sense topological since one is integrating\nover all metrics and therefore the theory does not depend on the metric. Similarly,\nin a quantum gravity theory we do not have any local observables. Notice that when\nwe say that the theory includes “gravity on AdS” we are considering any ﬁnite energy\nexcitation, even black holes in AdS. So this is really a sum over all spacetimes that are\nasymptotic to AdS at the boundary. This is analogous to the usual ﬂat space discussion\nof quantum gravity, where asymptotic ﬂatness is required, but the spacetime could have\nany topology as long as it is asymptotically ﬂat. The asymptotically AdS case as well\nas the asymptotically ﬂat cases are special in the sense that one can choose a natural\ntime and an associated Hamiltonian to deﬁne the quantum theory. Since black holes\nmight be present this time coordinate is not necessarily globally well-deﬁned, but it is\n8\n"}

If we assume that the conjecture we made above is\nvalid, then the U(N) Yang-Mills theory gives a non-perturbative deﬁnition of string\ntheory on AdS. And, by taking the limit N →∞, we can extract the (ten dimensional\nstring theory) ﬂat space physics, a procedure which is in principle (but not in detail)\nsimilar to the one used in matrix theory [26].\nThe fact that the ﬁeld theory lives in a lower dimensional space blends in perfectly\nwith some previous speculations about quantum gravity.\nIt was suggested [27, 28]\nthat quantum gravity theories should be holographic, in the sense that physics in some\nregion can be described by a theory at the boundary with no more than one degree of\nfreedom per Planck area. This “holographic” principle comes from thinking about the\nBekenstein bound which states that the maximum amount of entropy in some region\nis given by the area of the region in Planck units [29]. The reason for this bound is\nthat otherwise black hole formation could violate the second law of thermodynamics.\nWe will see that the correspondence between ﬁeld theories and string theory on AdS\nspace (including gravity) is a concrete realization of this holographic principle.\nThe review is organized as follows.\nIn the rest of the introductory chapter, we present background material. In section\n1.2, we present the ’t Hooft large N limit and its indication that gauge theories may\nbe dual to string theories. In section 1.3, we review the p-brane supergravity solutions.\nWe discuss D-branes, their worldvolume theory and their relation to the p-branes. We\ndiscuss greybody factors and their calculation for black holes built out of D-branes.\nIn chapter 2, we review conformal ﬁeld theories and AdS spaces.

String theory was originally developed as a theory\nfor the strong interactions, due to various string-like aspects of the strong interactions,\nsuch as conﬁnement and Regge behavior. It was later realized that there is another\ndescription of the strong interactions, in terms of an SU(3) gauge theory (QCD), which\nis consistent with all experimental data to date. However, while the gauge theory de-\nscription is very useful for studying the high-energy behavior of the strong interactions,\nit is very diﬃcult to use it to study low-energy issues such as conﬁnement and chiral\nsymmetry breaking (the only current method for addressing these issues in the full\nnon-Abelian gauge theory is by numerical simulations). In the last few years many\nexamples of the phenomenon generally known as “duality” have been discovered, in\nwhich a single theory has (at least) two diﬀerent descriptions, such that when one\ndescription is weakly coupled the other is strongly coupled and vice versa (examples of\nthis phenomenon in two dimensional ﬁeld theories have been known for many years).\nOne could hope that a similar phenomenon would apply in the theory of the strong\ninteractions, and that a “dual” description of QCD exists which would be more ap-\npropriate for studying the low-energy regime where the gauge theory description is\nstrongly coupled.\nThere are several indications that this “dual” description could be a string the-\nory. QCD has in it string-like objects which are the ﬂux tubes or Wilson lines. If\n10\n"}

It\nis clear that such a stringy description would have many desirable phenomenological\nattributes since, after all, this is how string theory was originally discovered. The most\ndirect indication from the gauge theory that it could be described in terms of a string\ntheory comes from the ’t Hooft large N limit [3], which we will now describe in detail.\nYang-Mills (YM) theories in four dimensions have no dimensionless parameters, since\nthe gauge coupling is dimensionally transmuted into the QCD scale ΛQCD (which is the\nonly mass scale in these theories). Thus, there is no obvious perturbation expansion\nthat can be performed to learn about the physics near the scale ΛQCD. However, an\nadditional parameter of SU(N) gauge theories is the integer number N, and one may\nhope that the gauge theories may simplify at large N (despite the larger number of\ndegrees of freedom), and have a perturbation expansion in terms of the parameter 1/N.\nThis turns out to be true, as shown by ’t Hooft based on the following analysis (reviews\nof large N QCD may be found in [34, 35]).\nFirst, we need to understand how to scale the coupling gY M as we take N →∞.\nIn an asymptotically free theory, like pure YM theory, it is natural to scale gY M so\nthat ΛQCD remains constant in the large N limit. The beta function equation for pure\nSU(N) YM theory is\nµdgY M\ndµ\n= −11\n3 N g3\nY M\n16π2 + O(g5\nY M),\n(1.1)\nso the leading terms are of the same order for large N if we take N →∞while keeping\nλ ≡g2\nY MN ﬁxed (one can show that the higher order terms are also of the same order\nin this limit). This is known as the ’t Hooft limit. The same behavior is valid if we\ninclude also matter ﬁelds (fermions or scalars) in the adjoint representation, as long as\nthe theory is still asymptotically free. If the theory is conformal, such as the N = 4\nSYM theory which we will discuss in detail below, it is not obvious that the limit of\nconstant λ is the only one that makes sense, and indeed we will see that other limits, in\nwhich λ →∞, are also possible. However, the limit of constant λ is still a particularly\ninteresting limit and we will focus on it in the remainder of this chapter.\nInstead of focusing just on the YM theory, let us describe a general theory which\nhas some ﬁelds Φa\ni , where a is an index in the adjoint representation of SU(N), and i\nis some label of the ﬁeld (a spin index, a ﬂavor index, etc.). Some of these ﬁelds can\nbe ghost ﬁelds (as will be the case in gauge theory). We will assume that as in the\nYM theory (and in the N = 4 SYM theory), the 3-point vertices of all these ﬁelds are\nproportional to gY M, and the 4-point functions to g2\nY M, so the Lagrangian is of the\n11\n"}

Naively, this is a classical limit since the coeﬃcient in front of the\nLagrangian diverges, but in fact this is not true since the number of components in\nthe ﬁelds also goes to inﬁnity in this limit. We can write the Feynman diagrams of\nthe theory (1.3) in a double line notation, in which an adjoint ﬁeld Φa is represented\nas a direct product of a fundamental and an anti-fundamental ﬁeld, Φi\nj, as in ﬁgure\n1.1. The interaction vertices we wrote are all consistent with this sort of notation. The\npropagators are also consistent with it in a U(N) theory; in an SU(N) theory there is\na small mixing term\nD\nΦi\njΦk\nl\nE\n∝(δi\nlδj\nk −1\nN δi\njδk\nl ),\n(1.4)\nwhich makes the expansion slightly more complicated, but this involves only subleading\nterms in the large N limit so we will neglect this diﬀerence here. Ignoring the second\nterm the propagator for the adjoint ﬁeld is (in terms of the index structure) like that of a\nfundamental-anti-fundamental pair. Thus, any Feynman diagram of adjoint ﬁelds may\nbe viewed as a network of double lines. Let us begin by analyzing vacuum diagrams\n(the generalization to adding external ﬁelds is simple and will be discussed below). In\nsuch a diagram we can view these double lines as forming the edges in a simplicial\ndecomposition (for example, it could be a triangulation) of a surface, if we view each\nsingle-line loop as the perimeter of a face of the simplicial decomposition. The resulting\nsurface will be oriented since the lines have an orientation (in one direction for a\nfundamental index and in the opposite direction for an anti-fundamental index). When\nwe compactify space by adding a point at inﬁnity, each diagram thus corresponds to a\ncompact, closed, oriented surface.\nWhat is the power of N and λ associated with such a diagram? From the form\nof (1.3) it is clear that each vertex carries a coeﬃcient proportional to N/λ, while\npropagators are proportional to λ/N. Additional powers of N come from the sum over\nthe indices in the loops, which gives a factor of N for each loop in the diagram (since\neach index has N possible values).

For example, the ﬁrst\ndiagram in ﬁgure 1.1 is planar and proportional to N2−3+3 = N2, while the second one\nis not and is proportional to N4−6+2 = N0. We presented our analysis for a general\ntheory, but in particular it is true for any gauge theory coupled to adjoint matter ﬁelds,\nlike the N = 4 SYM theory. The rest of our discussion will be limited mostly to gauge\ntheories, where only gauge-invariant (SU(N)-invariant) objects are usually of interest.\nThe form of the expansion (1.6) is the same as one ﬁnds in a perturbative theory\nwith closed oriented strings, if we identify 1/N as the string coupling constant3. Of\ncourse, we do not really see any strings in the expansion, but just diagrams with holes\nin them; however, one can hope that in a full non-perturbative description of the ﬁeld\ntheory the holes will “close” and the surfaces of the Feynman diagrams will become\nactual closed surfaces. The analogy of (1.6) with perturbative string theory is one\nof the strongest motivations for believing that ﬁeld theories and string theories are\nrelated, and it suggests that this relation would be more visible in the large N limit\nwhere the dual string theory may be weakly coupled.\nHowever, since the analysis\nwas based on perturbation theory which generally does not converge, it is far from a\nrigorous derivation of such a relation, but rather an indication that it might apply,\nat least for some ﬁeld theories (there are certainly also eﬀects like instantons which\nare non-perturbative in the 1/N expansion, and an exact matching with string theory\nwould require a matching of such eﬀects with non-perturbative eﬀects in string theory).\nThe fact that 1/N behaves as a coupling constant in the large N limit can also be\nseen directly in the ﬁeld theory analysis of the ’t Hooft limit. While we have derived the\nbehavior (1.6) only for vacuum diagrams, it actually holds for any correlation function\nof a product of gauge-invariant ﬁelds\nDQn\nj=1 Gj\nE\nsuch that each Gj cannot be written as\na product of two gauge-invariant ﬁelds (for instance, Gj can be of the form 1\nN Tr(Q\ni Φi)).\nWe can study such a correlation function by adding to the action S →S + N P gjGj,\nand then, if W is the sum of connected vacuum diagrams we discussed above (but now\ncomputed with the new action),\n* n\nY\nj=1\nGj\n+\n= (iN)−n\n\"\n∂nW\nQn\nj=1 ∂gj\n#\ngj=0\n.\n(1.7)\nOur analysis of the vacuum diagrams above holds also for these diagrams, since we\nput in additional vertices with a factor of N, and, in the double line representation,\neach of the operators we inserted becomes a vertex of the simplicial decomposition\nof the surface (this would not be true for operators which are themselves products,\n3In the conformal case, where λ is a free parameter, there is actually a freedom of choosing the\nstring coupling constant to be 1/N times any function of λ without changing the form of the expansion,\nand this will be used below.\n14\n"}

We see that (in terms of powers of N) the 2-point functions of the\nGj’s come out to be canonically normalized, while 3-point functions are proportional\nto 1/N, so indeed 1/N is the coupling constant in this limit (higher genus diagrams\ndo not aﬀect this conclusion since they just add higher order terms in 1/N). In the\nstring theory analogy the operators Gj would become vertex operators inserted on the\nstring world-sheet. For asymptotically free conﬁning theories (like QCD) one can show\nthat in the large N limit they have an inﬁnite spectrum of stable particles with rising\nmasses (as expected in a free string theory). Many additional properties of the large\nN limit are discussed in [36, 34] and other references.\nThe analysis we did of the ’t Hooft limit for SU(N) theories with adjoint ﬁelds\ncan easily be generalized to other cases. Matter in the fundamental representation\nappears as single-line propagators in the diagrams, which correspond to boundaries of\nthe corresponding surfaces. Thus, if we have such matter we need to sum also over\nsurfaces with boundaries, as in open string theories. For SO(N) or USp(N) gauge\ntheories we can represent the adjoint representation as a product of two fundamental\nrepresentations (instead of a fundamental and an anti-fundamental representation),\nand the fundamental representation is real, so no arrows appear on the propagators in\nthe diagram, and the resulting surfaces may be non-orientable. Thus, these theories\nseem to be related to non-orientable string theories [37]. We will not discuss these cases\nin detail here, some of the relevant aspects will be discussed in section 4.1.2 below.\nOur analysis thus far indicates that gauge theories may be dual to string theories\nwith a coupling proportional to 1/N in the ’t Hooft limit, but it gives no indication as to\nprecisely which string theory is dual to a particular gauge theory. For two dimensional\ngauge theories much progress has been made in formulating the appropriate string\ntheories [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45], but for four dimensional gauge theories there was\nno concrete construction of a corresponding string theory before the results reported\nbelow, since the planar diagram expansion (which corresponds to the free string theory)\nis very complicated. Various direct approaches towards constructing the relevant string\ntheory were attempted, many of which were based on the loop equations [46] for the\nWilson loop observables in the ﬁeld theory, which are directly connected to a string-\ntype description.\nAttempts to directly construct a string theory equivalent to a four dimensional gauge\ntheory are plagued with the well-known problems of string theory in four dimensions\n(or generally below the critical dimension).

Complete descriptions of all possible black\nhole solutions would be beyond the scope of this review, and we will discuss here only\nillustrative examples corresponding to parallel Dp branes. For a more extensive review\nof extended objects in string theory, see [60, 61].\nLet us consider type II string theory in ten dimensions, and look for a black hole\nsolution carrying electric charge with respect to the Ramond-Ramond (R-R) (p + 1)-\nform Ap+1 [50, 55, 58]. In type IIA (IIB) theory, p is even (odd). The theory contains\nalso magnetically charged (6−p)-branes, which are electrically charged under the dual\ndA7−p = ∗dAp+1 potential. Therefore, R-R charges have to be quantized according to\nthe Dirac quantization condition.

Since the strength\nof the curvature is characterized by r+, this requires r+ ≫ls. To suppress string loop\ncorrections, the eﬀective string coupling eφ also needs to be kept small. When p = 3,\nthe dilaton is constant and we can make it small everywhere in the 3-brane geome-\ntry by setting gs < 1, namely lP < ls. If gs > 1 we might need to do an S-duality,\ngs →1/gs, ﬁrst. Moreover, in this case it is known that the metric (1.21) can be\nanalytically extended beyond the horizon r = 0, and that the maximally extended\nmetric is geodesically complete and without a singularity [62].

For a review of D-\nbranes, see [63]. The Dp-brane is a (p + 1)-dimensional hyperplane in spacetime where\nan open string can end. By the worldsheet duality, this means that the D-brane is also\na source of closed strings (see Fig. 1.2). In particular, it can carry the R-R charges.\nIt was shown in [6] that, if we put N Dp-branes on top of each other, the resulting\n(p + 1)-dimensional hyperplane carries exactly N units of the (p + 1)-form charge. On\nthe worldsheet of a type II string, the left-moving degrees of freedom and the right-\nmoving degrees of freedom carry separate spacetime supercharges.\nSince the open\nstring boundary condition identiﬁes the left and right movers, the D-brane breaks at\nleast one half of the spacetime supercharges. In type IIA (IIB) string theory, precisely\none half of the supersymmetry is preserved if p is even (odd). This is consistent with\nthe types of R-R charges that appear in the theory. Thus, the Dp-brane is a BPS object\nin string theory which carries exactly the same charge as the black p-brane solution in\nsupergravity.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 1.2: (a) The D-brane is where open strings can end.

The D-brane uses the string worldsheet and,\ntherefore, is a good description in string perturbation theory. When there are N D-\nbranes on top of each other, the eﬀective loop expansion parameter for the open strings\nis gsN rather than gs, since each open string boundary loop ending on the D-branes\ncomes with the Chan-Paton factor N as well as the string coupling gs. Thus, the D-\nbrane description is good when gsN ≪1. This is complementary to the regime (1.27)\nwhere the supergravity description is appropriate.\nThe low energy eﬀective theory of open strings on the Dp-brane is the U(N) gauge\n20\n"}

It was noted in [14] that Hawking\nradiation could be mimicked by processes where two open strings collide on a D-brane\nand form a closed string which propagates into the bulk. The classic computation of\nHawking (see, for example, [64] for details) shows in a semi-classical approximation\nthat the diﬀerential rate of spontaneous emission of particles of energy ω from a black\nhole is\ndΓemit =\nvσabsorb\neω/TH ± 1\ndnk\n(2π)n ,\n(1.28)\nwhere v is the velocity of the emitted particle in the transverse directions, and the sign\nin the denominator is minus for bosons and plus for fermions. We use n to denote the\nnumber of spatial dimensions around the black hole (or if we are dealing with a black\nbrane, it is the number of spatial dimensions perpendicular to the world-volume of the\nbrane). TH is the Hawking temperature, and σabsorb is the cross-section for a particle\ncoming in from inﬁnity to be absorbed by the black hole. In the diﬀerential emission\nrate, the emitted particle is required to have a momentum in a small region dnk, and\nω is a function of k. To obtain a total emission rate we would integrate (1.28) over all\nk.\nIf σabsorb were a constant, then (1.28) tells us that the emission spectrum is the same\n5There is a potential P\nI,J Tr[ΦI, ΦJ]2 for the scalar ﬁelds, so expectation values of the matrices\nΦI (I = 1, · · · , 9 −p) minimizing the potential are simultaneously diagonalizable.\n21\n"}

In [16]\nand its many successors, it was shown that the D-branes provided an account of black\nhole microstates which was successful in this respect.\nOur ﬁrst goal will be to see how greybody factors are computed in the context of\nquantum ﬁelds in curved spacetime.

Typically the radial function cannot be expressed in terms of\nknown functions, so some approximation scheme is used, as we will explain in more\ndetail below. Boundary conditions are imposed at the black hole horizon corresponding\nto infalling matter. Once the solution is obtained, one can either use the asymptotics\n(1.29) to obtain Sℓand from it Pℓand σℓ\nabs, or compute the particle ﬂux at inﬁnity\nand at the horizon and note that particle number conservation implies that Pℓis their\nratio.\nOne of the few known universal results is that for ω/TH ≪1, σabs for an s-wave\nmassless scalar approaches the horizon area of the black hole [67].

Besides, for comparison with string\ntheory predictions we are generally interested only in this leading term.\nThe idea is to ﬁnd limiting forms of the radial equation which can be solved exactly,\nand then to match the limiting solutions together to approximate the full solution.\nUsually a uniformly good approximation can be found in the limit of small energy. The\nreason, intuitively speaking, is that on a compact range of radii excluding asymptotic\ninﬁnity and the horizon, the zero energy solution is nearly equal to solutions with very\nsmall energy; and outside this region the wave equation usually has a simple limiting\nform.

An interesting generalization of Poincar´e invariance\nis the addition of a scale invariance symmetry linking physics at diﬀerent scales (this\nis inconsistent with the existence of an S-matrix since it does not allow the standard\ndeﬁnition of asymptotic states). Many interesting ﬁeld theories, like Yang-Mills theory\nin four dimensions, are scale-invariant; generally this scale invariance does not extend\nto the quantum theory (whose deﬁnition requires a cutoﬀwhich explicitly breaks scale\ninvariance) but in some special cases (such as the d = 4, N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-\nMills theory) it does, and even when it does not (like in QCD) it can still be a useful\ntool, leading to relations like the Callan-Symanzik equation. It was realized in the past\n30 years that ﬁeld theories generally exhibit a renormalization group ﬂow from some\nscale-invariant (often free) UV ﬁxed point to some scale-invariant (sometimes trivial)\nIR ﬁxed point, and statistical mechanics systems also often have non-trivial IR scale-\ninvariant ﬁxed points. Thus, studying scale-invariant theories is interesting for various\nphysical applications.\nIt is widely believed that unitary interacting scale-invariant theories are always in-\nvariant under the full conformal group, which is a simple group including scale invari-\nance and Poincar´e invariance.

The vacuum of a conformal theory is annihi-\nlated by all of these generators.

This means that under\nthe scaling transformation (2.1) they transform as φ(x) →φ′(x) = λ∆φ(λx). The com-\nmutation relations (2.3) imply that the operator Pµ raises the dimension of the ﬁeld,\nwhile the operator Kµ lowers it. In unitary ﬁeld theories there is a lower bound on the\ndimension of ﬁelds (for scalar ﬁelds it is ∆≥(d −2)/2 which is the dimension of a free\nscalar ﬁeld), and, therefore, each representation of the conformal group which appears\nmust have some operator of lowest dimension, which must then be annihilated by Kµ\n(at x = 0). Such operators are called primary operators. The action of the conformal\ngroup on such operators is given by [82]\n[Pµ, Φ(x)] = i∂µΦ(x),\n[Mµν, Φ(x)] = [i(xµ∂ν −xν∂µ) + Σµν]Φ(x),\n[D, Φ(x)] = i(−∆+ xµ∂µ)Φ(x),\n[Kµ, Φ(x)] = [i(x2∂µ −2xµxν∂ν + 2xµ∆) −2xνΣµν]Φ(x),\n(2.5)\nwhere Σµν are the matrices of a ﬁnite dimensional representation of the Lorentz group,\nacting on the indices of the Φ ﬁeld.

There are fermionic\ngenerators S (one for each supersymmetry generator) which arise in the commutator\nof Kµ with Q, and there are (sometimes) R-symmetry generators forming some Lie\nalgebra, which appear in the anti-commutator of Q and S (the generators Q and S are\nin the fundamental representation of this Lie algebra).

Therefore,\nthe maximal possible number of fermionic generators in a ﬁeld theory superconformal\nalgebra is 32. Superconformal ﬁeld theories with this number of supercharges exist\nonly for d = 3, 4, 6 (d = 1 may also be possible but there are no known examples).

The spectrum of this compactiﬁcation is known from the work of [126, 85]. It is\na general feature of compactiﬁcations involving anti-de Sitter space that the positively\ncurved compact part has a radius of curvature on the same order as the negatively\ncurved anti-de Sitter part. As a result, the positive (mass)2 of Kaluza-Klein modes is\nof the same order as the negative (mass)2 of tachyonic modes. Thus there is no low-\nenergy limit in which one can argue that all but ﬁnitely many Kaluza-Klein harmonics\ndecouple. This was a traditional worry for all compactiﬁcations of eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity on squashed seven-spheres.\nHowever, fairly compelling evidence exists ([140] and references therein) that the\nreduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity on S7 can be consistently truncated to\nfour-dimensional N = 8 gauged supergravity. This is an exact statement about the\nequations of motion, and does not rely in any way on taking a low-energy limit. Put\nsimply, it means that any solution of the truncated theory can be lifted to a solution of\nthe untruncated theory. Charged black hole metrics in anti-de Sitter space provide a\nnon-trivial example of solutions that can be lifted to the higher-dimensional theory [141,\n142, 143].

We can have massless\nparticles propagating in the bulk region with wavelengths that becomes very large, or\nwe can have any kind of excitation that we bring closer and closer to r = 0. In the\nlow energy limit these two types of excitations decouple from each other. The bulk\nmassless particles decouple from the near horizon region (around r = 0) because the\nlow energy absorption cross section goes like σ ∼ω3R8 [10, 11], where ω is the energy.\nThis can be understood from the fact that in this limit the wavelength of the particle\nbecomes much bigger than the typical gravitational size of the brane (which is of order\nR). Similarly, the excitations that live very close to r = 0 ﬁnd it harder and harder to\nclimb the gravitational potential and escape to the asymptotic region. In conclusion,\nthe low energy theory consists of two decoupled pieces, one is free bulk supergravity\nand the second is the near horizon region of the geometry.

Therefore, the bulk AdS theory is describing the SU(N) part of the gauge\ntheory. In fact we were not precise when we said that there were two sets of excitations\nat low energies, the excitations in the asymptotic ﬂat space and the excitations in\nthe near horizon region.\nThere are also some zero modes which live in the region\nconnecting the “throat” (the near horizon region) with the bulk, which correspond to\nthe U(1) degrees of freedom mentioned above. The U(1) vector supermultiplet includes\nsix scalars which are related to the center of mass motion of all the branes [151]. From\nthe AdS point of view these zero modes live at the boundary, and it looks like we might\nor might not decide to include them in the AdS theory. Depending on this choice we\ncould have a correspondence to an SU(N) or a U(N) theory. The U(1) center of mass\ndegree of freedom is related to the topological theory of B-ﬁelds on AdS [152]; if one\nimposes local boundary conditions for these B-ﬁelds at the boundary of AdS one ﬁnds\na U(1) gauge ﬁeld living at the boundary [153], as is familiar in Chern-Simons theories\n[25, 154].\nThese modes living at the boundary are sometimes called singletons (or\ndoubletons) [155, 127, 156, 87, 88, 157, 158, 159, 160].\nAs we saw in section 2.2, Anti-de-Sitter space has a large group of isometries, which\nis SO(4, 2) for the case at hand. This is the same group as the conformal group in 3+1\ndimensions. Thus, the fact that the low-energy ﬁeld theory on the brane is conformal\nis reﬂected in the fact that the near horizon geometry is Anti-de-Sitter space. We also\nhave some supersymmetries. The number of supersymmetries is twice that of the full\nsolution (3.3) containing the asymptotic region [151]. This doubling of supersymmetries\nis viewed in the ﬁeld theory as a consequence of superconformal invariance (section\n2.2.3), since the superconformal algebra has twice as many fermionic generators as the\ncorresponding Poincare superalgebra. We also have an SO(6) symmetry which rotates\nthe S5. This can be identiﬁed with the SU(4)R R-symmetry group of the ﬁeld theory.\nIn fact, the whole supergroup is the same for the N = 4 ﬁeld theory and the AdS5 ×S5\ngeometry, so both sides of the conjecture have the same spacetime symmetries. We\nwill discuss in more detail the matching between the two sides of the correspondence\nin section 3.2.\nIn the above derivation the ﬁeld theory is naturally deﬁned on R3,1, but we saw\nin section 2.2.1 that we could also think of the conformal ﬁeld theory as deﬁned on\n58\n"}

This formulation of the conjecture is more\nuseful since in the global coordinates there is no horizon.

In fact, SL(2, Z)\nis a conjectured strong-weak coupling duality symmetry of type IIB string theory in\nﬂat space [162], and it should also be a symmetry in the present context since all the\nﬁelds that are being turned on in the AdS5 × S5 background (the metric and the ﬁve\nform ﬁeld strength) are invariant under this symmetry. The connection between the\nSL(2, Z) duality symmetries of type IIB string theory and N = 4 SYM was noted in\n[163, 164, 165].

However, this is not really a parameter in the theory if we do not\ncompare it to other scales in the theory, since only relative scales are meaningful. In\nfact, only the ratio of the radius of curvature to α′ is a parameter, but not α′ and\nthe radius of curvature independently. Thus, α′ will disappear from any ﬁnal physical\nquantity we compute in this theory. It is sometimes convenient, especially when one is\ndoing gravity calculations, to set the radius of curvature to one. This can be achieved\nby writing the metric as ds2 = R2d˜s2, and rewriting everything in terms of ˜g. With\nthese conventions GN ∼1/N2 and α′ ∼1/√gsN.

Then we can trust the gravity solution everywhere.\nAnother possibility is to separate just one brane (or a small number of branes)\nfrom a group of N branes. Then we can view this brane as a D3-brane in the AdS5\nbackground which is generated by the other branes (as described above). A string\nstretching between the brane probe and the N branes appears in the gravity description\nas a string stretching between the D3-brane and the horizon of AdS.

Suppose that we had a state with more entropy than Smax,\nthen we show that we could violate the second law of thermodynamics. We can throw\nin some extra matter such that we form a black hole. The entropy should not decrease.\nBut if a black hole forms inside the region its entropy is just the area of its horizon,\nwhich is smaller than the area of the boundary of the region (which by our assumption\nis smaller than the initial entropy). So, the second law has been violated.\nNote that this bound implies that the number of degrees of freedom inside some\nregion grows as the area of the boundary of a region and not like the volume of the\nregion. In standard quantum ﬁeld theories this is certainly not possible. Attempting\nto understand this behavior leads to the “holographic principle”, which states that in\na quantum gravity theory all physics within some volume can be described in terms of\nsome theory on the boundary which has less than one degree of freedom per Planck\narea [27, 28] (so that its entropy satisﬁes the Bekenstein bound).\nIn the AdS/CFT correspondence we are describing physics in the bulk of AdS space\nby a ﬁeld theory of one less dimension (which can be thought of as living on the\nboundary), so it looks like holography. However, it is hard to check what the number\nof degrees of freedom per Planck area is, since the theory, being conformal, has an\ninﬁnite number of degrees of freedom, and the area of the boundary of AdS space is\nalso inﬁnite. Thus, in order to compare things properly we should introduce a cutoﬀ\non the number of degrees of freedom in the ﬁeld theory and see what it corresponds to\nin the gravity theory. For this purpose let us write the metric of AdS as\nds2 = R2\n\n−\n 1 + r2\n1 −r2\n!2\ndt2 +\n4\n(1 −r2)2(dr2 + r2dΩ2)\n\n.\n(3.16)\nIn these coordinates the boundary of AdS is at r = 1.

In the ’t Hooft large N limit, it relates the region of weak ﬁeld theory coupling\nλ = g2\nY MN in the SYM theory to the region of high curvature (in string units) in the\nstring theory, and vice versa. Thus, a direct comparison of correlation functions is\ngenerally not possible, since (with our current knowledge) we can only compute most\nof them perturbatively in λ on the ﬁeld theory side and perturbatively in 1/\n√\nλ on the\nstring theory side. For example, as described below, we can compute the equation of\nstate of the SYM theory and also the quark-anti-quark potential both for small λ and\nfor large λ, and we obtain diﬀerent answers, which we do not know how to compare\nsince we can only compute them perturbatively on both sides.

Representations of the superconformal\nalgebra are formed by starting with some state of lowest dimension, which is anni-\nhilated by the operators S and Kµ, and acting on it with the operators Q and Pµ.\nThe N = 4 supersymmetry algebra involves 16 real supercharges. A generic primary\nrepresentation of the superconformal algebra will thus include 216 primaries of the\nconformal algebra, generated by acting on the lowest state with products of diﬀerent\nsupercharges; acting with additional supercharges always leads to descendants of the\nconformal algebra (i.e. derivatives). Since the supercharges have helicities ±1/2, the\nprimary ﬁelds in such representations will have a range of helicities between λ −4 (if\nthe lowest dimension operator ψ has helicity λ) and λ + 4 (acting with more than 8\nsupercharges of the same helicity either annihilates the state or leads to a conformal\ndescendant). In non-generic representations of the superconformal algebra a product\nof less than 16 diﬀerent Q’s annihilates the lowest dimension operator, and the range\nof helicities appearing is smaller. In particular, in the small representations of the\nN = 4 superconformal algebra only up to 4 Q’s of the same helicity acting on the\nlowest dimension operator give a non-zero result, and the range of helicities is between\nλ −2 and λ + 2. For the N = 4 supersymmetry algebra (not including the conformal\nalgebra) it is known that medium representations, whose range of helicities is 6, can\nalso exist (they arise, for instance, on the moduli space of the SU(N) N = 4 SYM\ntheory [188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195]); it is not clear if such medium repre-\nsentations of the superconformal algebra [196] can appear in physical theories or not\n(there are no known examples). More details on the structure of representations of the\nN = 4 superconformal algebra may be found in [85, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 196] and\nreferences therein.\n71\n"}

These operators form an ultra-short representation of the N = 4\nalgebra whose range of helicities is from (−1) to 1 (acting with more than two su-\npercharges of the same helicity on any of these states gives either zero or derivatives,\nwhich are descendants of the conformal algebra).

In the context of AdS\nspace one can think of this multiplet as living purely on the boundary of the space\n[202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 87, 86, 207, 208, 209, 210], as expected for the U(1) part of\nthe original U(N) gauge group of the D3-branes (see the discussion in section 3.1).\nThere is no known simple systematic way to compute the full spectrum of chiral\nprimary operators of the N = 4 SU(N) SYM theory, so we will settle for presenting the\nknown chiral primary operators. The lowest component of a superconformal-primary\nmultiplet is characterized by the fact that it cannot be written as a supercharge Q\nacting on any other operator. Looking at the action of the supersymmetry charges\n(3.23) suggests that generally operators built from the fermions and the gauge ﬁelds\nwill be descendants (given by Q acting on some other ﬁelds), so one would expect\nthe lowest components of the chiral primary representations to be built only from the\nscalar ﬁelds, and this turns out to be correct.\nLet us analyze the behavior of operators of the form OI1I2···In ≡Tr(φI1φI2 · · · φIn).\nFirst we can ask if this operator can be written as {Q, ψ} for any ﬁeld ψ. In the\nSUSY algebra (3.23) only commutators of φI’s appear on the right hand side, so we see\nthat if some of the indices are antisymmetric the ﬁeld will be a descendant. Thus, only\nsymmetric combinations of the indices will be lowest components of primary multiplets.\nNext, we should ask if the multiplet built on such an operator is a (short) chiral\nprimary multiplet or not. There are several diﬀerent ways to answer this question.\nOne possibility is to use the relation between the dimension of chiral primary operators\nand their R-symmetry representation [94, 95, 96, 93, 97], and to check if this relation\nis obeyed in the free ﬁeld theory, where [OI1I2···In] = n. In this way we ﬁnd that the\nrepresentation is chiral primary if and only if the indices form a symmetric traceless\nproduct of n 6’s (traceless representations are deﬁned as those who give zero when\nany two indices are contracted). This is a representation of weight (0, n, 0) of SU(4)R;\nin this section we will refer to SU(4)R representations either by their dimensions in\nboldface or by their weights.\nAnother way to check this is to see if by acting with Q’s on these operators we get the\nmost general possible states or not, namely if the representation contains “null vectors”\n72\n"}

For instance, let us analyze in detail the\ncase n = 2. The symmetric product of two 6’s is given by 6 × 6 →1 + 20′. The\nﬁeld in the 1 representation is Tr(φIφI), for which [QA\nα, Tr(φIφI)] ∼CAJBTr(λαBφJ)\nwhere CAIB is a Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient for ¯4 × 6 →4.\nThe right-hand side is\nin the 4 representation, which is the most general representation that can appear in\nthe product 4 × 1, so we ﬁnd no null vectors at this level. On the other hand, if we\nlook at the symmetric traceless product Tr(φ{IφJ}) ≡Tr(φIφJ)−1\n6δIJTr(φKφK) in the\n20′ representation, we ﬁnd that {QA\nα, Tr(φ{IφJ})} ∼Tr(λαBφK) with the right-hand\nside being in the 20 representation (appearing in ¯4 × 6 →4 + 20), while the left-hand\nside could in principle be in the 4 × 20′ →20 + 60. Since the 60 does not appear on\nthe right-hand side (it is a “null vector”) we identify that the representation built on\nthe 20′ is a short representation of the SUSY algebra. By similar manipulations (see\n[20, 211, 197, 200] for more details) one can verify that chiral primary representations\ncorrespond exactly to symmetric traceless products of 6’s.\nIt is possible to analyze the chiral primary spectrum also by using N = 1 subalgebras\nof the N = 4 algebra. If we use an N = 1 subalgebra of the N = 4 algebra, as described\nabove, the operators On include the chiral operators of the form Tr(Φi1Φi2 · · · Φin) (in\na representation of SU(3) which is a symmetric product of 3’s), but for a particular\nchoice of the N = 1 subalgebra not all the operators On appear to be chiral (a short\nmultiplet of the N = 4 algebra includes both short and long multiplets of the N = 1\nsubalgebra).\nThe last issue we should discuss is what is the range of values of n. The product\nof more than N commuting3 N × N matrices can always be written as a sum of\nproducts of traces of less than N of the matrices, so it does not form an independent\noperator. This means that for n > N we can express the operator OI1I2···In in terms\nof other operators, up to operators including commutators which (as explained above)\nare descendants of the SUSY algebra. Thus, we ﬁnd that the short chiral primary\nrepresentations are built on the operators On = O{I1I2···In} with n = 2, 3, · · ·, N, for\nwhich the indices are in the symmetric traceless product of n 6’s (in a U(N) theory\nwe would ﬁnd the same spectrum with the additional representation corresponding to\nn = 1). The superconformal algebra determines the dimension of these ﬁelds to be\n[On] = n, which is the same as their value in the free ﬁeld theory. We argued above\n3We can limit the discussion to commuting matrices since, as discussed above, commutators always\nlead to descendants, and we can write any product of matrices as a product of commuting matrices\nplus terms with commutators.\n73\n"}

String theory on AdS5 × S5 is\nexpected to have many additional states, with masses of the order of the string scale 1/ls\nor of the Planck scale 1/lp.

The computation involves expanding the ten dimensional ﬁelds in appropriate\nspherical harmonics on S5, plugging them into the supergravity equations of motion,\nlinearized around the AdS5 × S5 background, and diagonalizing the equations to give\nequations of motion for free (massless or massive) ﬁelds4. For example, the ten dimen-\nsional dilaton ﬁeld τ may be expanded as τ(x, y) =\nP∞\nk=0 τ k(x)Y k(y) where x is a coor-\ndinate on AdS5, y is a coordinate on S5, and the Y k are the scalar spherical harmonics\non S5.

This is one of the reasons why it\nseems more natural to view the corresponding gauge theory as an SU(N) gauge theory\nand not a U(N) theory. It may be possible (and perhaps even natural) to add the\ndoubleton representation to the theory (even though it does not include modes which\npropagate in the bulk of AdS5, but instead it is equivalent to a topological theory in\nthe bulk) to obtain a theory which is dual to the U(N) gauge theory, but this will not\naﬀect most of our discussion in this review so we will ignore this possibility here.\nComparing the results described above with the results of section 3.2.1, we see that\nwe ﬁnd the same spectrum of chiral primary operators for n = 2, 3, · · ·, N.

A free ﬁeld computation in the SU(N) N = 4 SYM theory leads\nto a = c = (N2 −1)/4. In supersymmetric theories the supersymmetry algebra relates\ngµνTµν to derivatives of the R-symmetry current, so it is protected from any quantum\ncorrections. Thus, the same result should be obtained in type IIB string theory on\nAdS5 × S5, and to leading order in the large N limit it should be obtained from type\nIIB supergravity on AdS5×S5. This was indeed found to be true in [226, 227, 228, 229]5,\nwhere the conformal anomaly was shown to arise from subtleties in the regularization\nof the (divergent) supergravity action on AdS space. The result of [226, 227, 228, 229]\nimplies that a computation using gravity on AdS5 always gives rise to theories with\n5A generalization with more varying ﬁelds may be found in [230].\n79\n"}

Of course, if we do not require the string theory to have a supergravity\napproximation then there is no such restriction.\nFor both of the anomalies we described the ﬁeld theory and string theory computa-\ntions agree for the leading terms, which are of order N2. Thus, they are successful tests\nof the duality in the large N limit. For other instances of the AdS/CFT correspondence\nthere are corrections to anomalies at order 1/N ∼gs(α′/R2)2; such corrections were\ndiscussed in [231] and successfully compared in [232, 233, 234]6. It would be interesting\nto compare other corrections to the large N result.\nComputations of other correlation functions [235, 236, 237], such as 3-point func-\ntions of chiral primary operators and correlation functions which have only instanton\ncontributions (we will discuss these in section 4.2), have suggested that they are also\nthe same at small λ and at large λ, even though they are not related to anomalies in\nany known way. Perhaps there is some non-renormalization theorem also for these cor-\nrelation functions, in which case their agreement would also be a test of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. As discussed in [238, 239] (see also [146]) the non-renormalization\ntheorem for 3-point functions of chiral primary operators would follow from a conjec-\ntured U(1)Y symmetry of the 3-point functions of N = 4 SCFTs involving at least two\noperators which are descendants of chiral primaries7. This symmetry is a property of\ntype IIB supergravity on AdS5 × S5 but not of the full type IIB string theory.\n3.3\nCorrelation Functions\nA useful statement of the AdS/CFT correspondence is that the partition function of\nstring theory on AdS5 ×S5 should coincide with the partition function of N = 4 super-\nYang-Mills theory “on the boundary” of AdS5 [19, 20]. The basic idea was explained\nin section 3.1.2, but before summarizing the actual calculations of Green’s functions, it\nseems worthwhile to motivate the methodology from a somewhat diﬀerent perspective.\nThroughout this section, we approximate the string theory partition function by\ne−ISUGRA, where ISUGRA is the supergravity action evaluated on AdS5 ×S5 (or on small\ndeformations of this space). This approximation amounts to ignoring all the stringy α′\ncorrections that cure the divergences of supergravity, and also all the loop corrections,\nwhich are controlled essentially by the gravitational coupling κ ∼gstα′2. On the gauge\n6Computing such corrections tests the conjecture that the correspondence holds order by order in\n1/N; however, this is weaker than the statement that the correspondence holds for ﬁnite N, since the\n1/N expansion is not expected to converge.\n7A proof of this, using the analytic harmonic superspace formalism which is conjectured to be valid\nin the N = 4 theory, was recently given in [240].\n80\n"}

At ﬁnite temperature, W = βF where β is the inverse temperature and F is the\nfree energy of the gauge theory. When we apply this relation to a Schwarzschild black\nhole in AdS5, which is thought to be reﬂected in the gauge theory by a thermal state\nat the Hawking temperature of the black hole, we arrive at the relation ISUGRA ≃βF.\nCalculating the free energy of a black hole from the Euclidean supergravity action has\na long tradition in the supergravity literature [241], so the main claim that is being\nmade here is that the dual gauge theory provides a description of the state of the black\nhole which is physically equivalent to the one in string theory. We will discuss the\nﬁnite temperature case further in section 3.6, and devote the rest of this section to the\npartition function of the ﬁeld theory on R4.\nThe main technical idea behind the bulk-boundary correspondence is that the bound-\nary values of string theory ﬁelds (in particular, supergravity ﬁelds) act as sources for\ngauge-invariant operators in the ﬁeld theory. From a D-brane perspective, we think of\nclosed string states in the bulk as sourcing gauge singlet operators on the brane which\noriginate as composite operators built from open strings. We will write the bulk ﬁelds\ngenerically as φ(⃗x, z) (in the coordinate system (3.17)), with value φ0(⃗x) for z = ǫ.\nThe true boundary of anti-de Sitter space is z = 0, and ǫ ̸= 0 serves as a cutoﬀwhich\nwill eventually be removed. In the supergravity approximation, we think of choosing\nthe values φ0 arbitrarily and then extremizing the action ISUGRA[φ] in the region z > ǫ\nsubject to these boundary conditions. In short, we solve the equations of motion in\nthe bulk subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on the boundary, and evaluate the\naction on the solution. If there is more than one solution, then we have more than\none saddle point contributing to the string theory partition function, and we must\ndetermine which is most important.

In absorption calculations one\nis keeping the whole D3-brane geometry, not just the near-horizon AdS5 × S5 throat.\nThe usual treatment is to split the space into a near region (the throat) and a far\nregion. The incoming wave from asymptotically ﬂat inﬁnity can be regarded as ﬁxing\nthe value of a supergravity ﬁeld at the outer boundary of the near region. As usual,\nthe supergravity description is valid at large N and large ’t Hooft coupling. At small\n’t Hooft coupling, there is a diﬀerent description of the process: a cluster of D3-branes\nsits at some location in ﬂat ten-dimensional space, and the incoming wave impinges\nupon it. In the low-energy limit, the value of the supergravity ﬁeld which the D3-branes\nfeel is the same as the value in the curved space description at the boundary of the\nnear horizon region. Equation (3.34) is just a mathematical expression of the fact that\nthe throat geometry should respond identically to the perturbed supergravity ﬁelds as\nthe low-energy theory on the D3-branes.\nFollowing [19, 20], a number of papers—notably [242, 243, 219, 244, 220, 245, 246,\n235, 247, 236, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254]—have undertaken the program of ex-\ntracting explicit n-point correlation functions of gauge singlet operators by developing\nboth sides of (3.34) in a power series in φ0. Because the right hand side is the extrem-\nization of a classical action, the power series has a graphical representation in terms\nof tree-level Feynman graphs for ﬁelds in the supergravity. There is one diﬀerence: in\nordinary Feynman graphs one assigns the wavefunctions of asymptotic states to the\nexternal legs of the graph, but in the present case the external leg factors reﬂect the\nboundary values φ0. They are special limits of the usual gravity propagators in the\nbulk, and are called bulk-to-boundary propagators.

One can choose ˜wI so that a two-point function computation along the\nlines of section 3.3.1 leads to\n⟨OI1(⃗x)OI2(0)⟩= δI1I2\nx2∆1 .\n(3.48)\nWith this choice, the three-point function, as calculated using (3.44), is\n⟨OI1( ⃗x1)OI2( ⃗x2)OI3( ⃗x3)⟩= 1\nN\n√∆1∆2∆3⟨CI1CI2CI3⟩\n|⃗x1 −⃗x2|∆1+∆2−∆3|⃗x1 −⃗x3|∆1+∆3−∆2|⃗x2 −⃗x3|∆2+∆3−∆1 ,\n(3.49)\nwhere we have deﬁned\n⟨CI1CI2CI3⟩= CI1\nJ1···JiK1···KjCI2\nJ1···JiL1···LkCI3\nK1···KjL1···Lk .\n(3.50)\nRemarkably, (3.49) is the same result one obtains from free ﬁeld theory by Wick con-\ntracting all the φJ ﬁelds in the three operators. This suggests that there is a non-\nrenormalization theorem for this correlation function, but such a theorem has not yet\nbeen proven (see however comments at the end of section 3.2.2). It is worth emphasiz-\ning that the normalization ambiguity in the bulk-boundary coupling is circumvented\nessentially by considering invariant ratios of three-point functions and two-point func-\ntions, into which the “leg factors” wI do not enter. This is the same strategy as was\npursued in comparing matrix models of quantum gravity to Liouville theory.\n88\n"}

From\nthe expectation value of the Wilson loop operator ⟨W(C)⟩we can calculate the quark-\nantiquark potential.\nFor this purpose we consider a rectangular loop with sides of\nlength T and L in Euclidean space. Then, viewing T as the time direction, it is clear\nthat for large T the expectation value will behave as e−TE where E is the lowest possible\nenergy of the quark-anti-quark conﬁguration. Thus, we have\n⟨W⟩∼e−TV (L) ,\n(3.84)\nwhere V (L) is the quark anti-quark potential.\nFor large N and large g2\nY MN, the\nAdS/CFT correspondence maps the computation of ⟨W⟩in the CFT into a problem\nof ﬁnding a minimum surface in AdS [294, 295].\n3.5.1\nWilson Loops and Minimum Surfaces\nIn QCD, we expect the Wilson loop to be related to the string running from the quark to\nthe antiquark. We expect this string to be analogous to the string in our conﬁguration,\nwhich is a superstring which lives in ten dimensions, and which can stretch between\ntwo points on the boundary of AdS.\nIn order to motivate this prescription let us\nconsider the following situation. We start with the gauge group U(N + 1), and we\nbreak it to U(N) × U(1) by giving an expectation value to one of the scalars. This\ncorresponds, as discussed in section 3.1, to having a D3 brane sitting at some radial\nposition U in AdS, and at a point on S5. The oﬀ-diagonal states, transforming in the\nN of U(N), get a mass proportional to U, m = U/2π. So, from the point of view of\n98\n"}

Since they are charged they will act as a source for\nthe vector ﬁelds. In order to get a non-dynamical source (an “external quark” with no\nﬂuctuations of its own, which will correspond precisely to the Wilson loop operator)\nwe need to take m →∞, which means U should also go to inﬁnity. Thus, the string\nshould end on the boundary of AdS space.\nThese stretched strings will also act as a source for the scalar ﬁelds. The coupling to\nthe scalar ﬁelds can be seen qualitatively by viewing the quarks as strings stretching\nbetween the N branes and the single separated brane. These strings will pull the N\nbranes and will cause a deformation of the branes, which is described by the scalar\nﬁelds. A more formal argument for this coupling is that these states are BPS, and\nthe coupling to the scalar (Higgs) ﬁelds is determined by supersymmetry. Finally, one\ncan see this coupling explicitly by writing the full U(N + 1) Lagrangian, putting in\nthe Higgs expectation value and calculating the equation of motion for the massive\nﬁelds [294]. The precise deﬁnition of the Wilson loop operator corresponding to the\nsuperstring will actually include also the ﬁeld theory fermions, which will imply some\nparticular boundary conditions for the worldsheet fermions at the boundary of AdS.\nHowever, this will not aﬀect the leading order computations we describe here.\nSo, the ﬁnal conclusion is that the stretched strings couple to the operator\nW(C) = Tr\n\u0014\nP exp\n\u0012I\n(iAµ ˙xµ + θIφI√\n˙x2)dτ\n\u0013\u0015\n,\n(3.85)\nwhere xµ(τ) is any parametrization of the loop and θI (I = 1, · · ·, 6) is a unit vector in\nR6 (the point on S5 where the string is sitting).

The apparent discrepancy between\nthe divergence of the area of the minimum surface in AdS and the ﬁniteness of the\nﬁeld theory computation can be reconciled by noting that the appropriate action for\nthe string worldsheet is not the area itself but its Legendre transform with respect to\nthe string coordinates corresponding to θI and the radial coordinate u [296]. This is\nbecause these string coordinates obey the Neumann boundary conditions rather than\nthe Dirichlet conditions. When the loop is smooth, the Legendre transformation simply\nsubtracts the divergent term r|C|, leaving the resulting action ﬁnite.\nAs an example let us consider a circular Wilson loop.

Since\nwe identify the electric-magnetic duality with the SL(2, Z) duality of type IIB string\ntheory, we should consider in this case a D-string worldsheet instead of a fundamental\nstring worldsheet. We get the same result as in (3.88) but with gs →1/gs.\nUsing (3.84) it is possible to compute the quark-antiquark potential in the supergrav-\nity approximation [295, 294]. In this case we consider a conﬁguration which is invariant\nunder (Euclidean) time translations. We take both particles to have the same scalar\ncharge, which means that the two ends of the string are at the same point in S5 (one\ncould consider also the more general case with a string ending at diﬀerent points on S5\n[294]).

Some subleading corrections coming from quantum ﬂuctuations of\nthe worldsheet were calculated in [298, 299, 300].\nIn a similar fashion we could compute the potential between two magnetic monopoles\nin terms of a D-string worldsheet, and the result will be the same as (3.95) but with\ngY M →4π/gY M. One can also calculate the interaction between a magnetic monopole\nand a quark. In this case the fundamental string (ending on the quark) will attach to\nthe D-string (ending on the monopole), and they will connect to form a (1, 1) string\nwhich will go into the horizon. The resulting potential is a complicated function of\ngY M [301], but in the limit that gY M is small (but still with g2\nY MN large) we get\nthat the monopole-quark potential is just 1/4 of the quark-quark potential. This can\nbe understood from the fact that when g is small the D-string is very rigid and the\nfundamental string will end almost perpendicularly on the D-string. Therefore, the\nsolution for the fundamental string will be half of the solution we had above, leading\nto a factor of 1/4 in the potential. Calculations of Wilson loops in the Higgs phase\nwere done in [302].\nAnother interesting case one can study analytically is a surface near a cusp on R4.\nIn this case, the perturbative computation in the gauge theory shows a logarithmic\ndivergence with a coeﬃcient depending on the angle at the cusp.\nThe area of the\nminimum surface also contains a logarithmic divergence depending on the angle [296].\nOther aspects of the gravity calculation of Wilson loops were discussed in [303, 304,\n305, 306, 307].\n102\n"}

In particular one could consider the “Wilson\nsurfaces” that arise in the six dimensional N = (2, 0) theory which will be discussed in\nsection 6.1.1.

For X2, the elimination of the conical deﬁcit angle\nat the horizon ﬁxes the period of Euclidean time; but for X1, the period is arbitrary.\nIn order to make the comparison of I(X1) and I(X2) meaningful, we ﬁx the period of\nEuclidean time on X1 so that the proper circumference of the S1 at r = R0 is the same\nas the proper length on X2 of an orbit of the Killing vector ∂/∂t, also at r = R0. In\nthe limit R0 →∞, one ﬁnds\nI(X2) −I(X1) = π2r3\n+(R2 −r2\n+)\n4G5(2r2\n+ + R2) ,\n(3.105)\nwhere again r+ is the largest root of f = 0. The fact that (3.105) (or more precisely\nits AdS4 analog) can change its sign was interpreted in [289] as indicating a phase\ntransition between a black hole in AdS and a thermal gas of particles in AdS (which\nis the natural interpretation of the space X1). The black hole is the thermodynam-\nically favored state when the horizon radius r+ exceeds the radius of curvature R of\nAdS. In the gauge theory we interpret this transition as a conﬁnement-deconﬁnement\ntransition. Since the theory is conformally invariant, the transition temperature must\nbe proportional to the inverse radius of the space S3 which the ﬁeld theory lives on.\nSimilar transitions, and also local thermodynamic instability due to negative speciﬁc\nheats, have been studied in the context of spinning branes and charged black holes\n108\n"}

Most of these works are best understood on\nthe CFT side as explorations of exotic thermal phenomena in ﬁnite-temperature gauge\ntheories. Connections with Higgsed states in gauge theory are clearer in [322, 323].\nThe relevance to conﬁnement is explored in [320]. See also [324, 325, 326, 285] for\nother interesting contributions to the ﬁnite temperature literature.\nDeconﬁnement at high temperature can be characterized by a spontaneous breaking\nof the center of the gauge group. In our case the gauge group is SU(N) and its center\nis ZN. The order parameter for the breaking of the center is the expectation value of\nthe Polyakov (temporal) loop ⟨W(C)⟩. The boundary of the spaces X1, X2 is S3 × S1,\nand the path C wraps around the circle. An element of the center g ∈ZN acts on the\nPolyakov loop by ⟨W(C)⟩→g⟨W(C)⟩. The expectation value of the Polyakov loop\nmeasures the change of the free energy of the system Fq(T) induced by the presence\nof the external charge q, ⟨W(C)⟩∼exp (−Fq(T)/T). In a conﬁning phase Fq(T) is\ninﬁnite and therefore ⟨W(C)⟩= 0. In the deconﬁned phase Fq(T) is ﬁnite and therefore\n⟨W(C)⟩̸= 0.\nAs discussed in section 3.5, in order to compute ⟨W(C)⟩we have to evaluate the\npartition function of strings with a worldsheet D that is bounded by the loop C.\nConsider ﬁrst the low temperature phase. The relevant space is X1 which, as discussed\nabove, has the topology B4 ×S1. The contour C wraps the circle and is not homotopic\nto zero in X1. Therefore C is not a boundary of any D, which immediately implies\nthat ⟨W(C)⟩= 0. This is the expected behavior at low temperatures (compared to\nthe inverse radius of the S3), where the center of the gauge group is not broken.\nFor the high temperature phase the relevant space is X2, which has the topology\nS3 × B2. The contour C is now a boundary of a string worldsheet D = B2 (times a\npoint in S3). This seems to be in agreement with the fact that in the high temperature\nphase ⟨W(C)⟩̸= 0 and the center of the gauge group is broken. It was pointed out\nin [185] that there is a subtlety with this argument, since the center should not be\nbroken in ﬁnite volume (S3), but only in the inﬁnite volume limit (R3). Indeed, the\nsolution X2 is not unique and we can add to it an expectation value for the integral\nof the NS-NS 2-form ﬁeld B on B2, with vanishing ﬁeld strength. This is an angular\nparameter ψ with period 2π, which contributes iψ to the string worldsheet action. The\nstring theory partition function includes now an integral over all values of ψ, making\n⟨W(C)⟩= 0 on S3. In contrast, on R3 one integrates over the local ﬂuctuations of\nψ but not over its vacuum expectation value. Now ⟨W(C)⟩̸= 0 and depends on the\nvalue of ψ ∈U(1), which may be understood as the dependence on the center ZN in\nthe large N limit. Explicit computations of Polyakov loops at ﬁnite temperature were\ndone in [327, 328].\nIn [185] the Euclidean black hole solution (3.103) was suggested to be holographically\ndual to a theory related to pure QCD in three dimensions.

These cases will be discussed in sections 4.1.1 and\n4.1.2. Another interesting case is the conifold singularity [217] and its generalizations,\nwhich will be discussed in section 4.1.3. In this case a direct analysis of the ﬁeld theory\nis not possible, but various indirect arguments can be used to determine what it is in\nmany cases.\nNot much is known about more general cases of near-horizon limits of D3-branes,\nwhich on the string theory side were analyzed in [331, 332, 333, 334, 335], and even\nless is known about backgrounds which are not describable as near-horizon limits of\nbranes (several AdS5 backgrounds were discussed in [336]). An example of the latter\nis the AdS5 × CP3 background of M theory [337], which involves a 4-form ﬂux on the\n4-cycle in CP3. Using the methods described in the previous sections we can compute\nvarious properties of such compactiﬁcations in the large N limit, such as the mass\nspectrum and the central charge of the corresponding ﬁeld theories (for the AdS5×CP3\ncompactiﬁcation one ﬁnds a central charge proportional to N3, where N is the 4-form\nﬂux). However, it is not known how to construct an alternative description of the\nconformal ﬁeld theory in most of these cases, except for the cases which are related by\ndeformations to the better-understood orbifold and conifold compactiﬁcations.\nSome of the AdS5 × X backgrounds of string/M theory preserve some number of\nsupersymmetries, but most of them (such as the AdS5 × CP3 background) do not.\nIn supersymmetric cases, supersymmetry guarantees the stability of the corresponding\nsolutions. In the non-supersymmetric cases various instabilities may arise for ﬁnite N\n(see, for instance, [338, 339]) which may destroy the conformal (SO(4, 2)) invariance,\nbut the correspondence is still conjectured to be valid when all quantum corrections\nare taken into account (or in the inﬁnite N limit for which the supergravity approxima-\ntion is valid). One type of instability occurs when the spectrum includes a tachyonic\nﬁeld whose mass is below the Breitenlohner-Freedman stability bound.

Generally the gauge group is of the form\nQ\ni U(aiN), and there are various bifundamental (and sometimes also adjoint) matter\nﬁelds2. We are interested in the near-horizon limit of D3-branes sitting at the origin of\nR4 ×R6/Γ for some ﬁnite group Γ which is a discrete subgroup of the SO(6) ≃SU(4)R\nrotation symmetry [330]. If Γ ⊂SU(3) ⊂SU(4)R the theory on the D3-branes has\nN = 1 supersymmetry, and if Γ ⊂SU(2) ⊂SU(4)R it has N = 2 supersymmetry. The\nnear-horizon limit of such a conﬁguration is of the form AdS5×S5/Γ (since the orbifold\ncommutes with taking the near-horizon limit), and corresponds (at least for large N)\n2In general one can choose to have the orbifold group act on the Chan-Paton indices in various\nways. We will discuss here only the case where the group acts as N copies of the regular representation\nof the orbifold group Γ, which is the only case which leads to conformal theories. Other representations\ninvolve also 5-branes wrapped around 2-cycles, so they do not arise in the naive near-horizon limit of\nD3-branes. The AdS5 description of this was given in [218].\n113\n"}

On the other hand, if the\noriginal action had a space of ﬁxed points, some ﬁxed points remain, and the space\nS5/Γ includes orbifold singularities. In this case the space is not geometrically smooth,\nand the supergravity approximation is not valid (though of course in string theory it is\na standard orbifold compactiﬁcation which is generically not singular). The spectrum\nof string theory on AdS5 × S5/Γ includes states from untwisted and twisted sectors of\nthe orbifold. The untwisted states are just the Γ-projection of the original states of\nAdS5 × S5, and they include in particular the Γ-invariant supergravity states. These\nstates have (in the classical supergravity limit) the same masses as in the original\nAdS5 × S5 background [347], corresponding to integer dimensions in the ﬁeld theory,\nwhich is why we often ﬁnd in orbifolds operators of dimension 2 or 4 which can desta-\nbilize non-supersymmetric backgrounds. If the orbifold group has ﬁxed points on the\nS5, there are also light twisted sector states that are localized near these ﬁxed points,\nwhich need to be added to the supergravity ﬁelds for a proper description of the low-\nenergy dynamics. On the other hand, if the orbifold has no ﬁxed points, all twisted\nsector states are heavy,4 since they involve strings stretching between identiﬁed points\non the S5. In this case the twisted sector states decouple from the low-energy theory\nin space-time (for large gsN).

This may easily be seen also\non the string theory side, where the central charge may be shown [173] to be inversely\nproportional to the volume of the compact space (and Vol(S5/Γ) = Vol(S5)/dim(Γ)).\nThe vanishing of the beta function in the ’t Hooft limit follows from this general\nresult (as predicted by the AdS/CFT correspondence).

The spectrum of ﬁelds on AdS5 in this\nbackground was successfully compared [356] to the spectrum of chiral operators in the\nﬁeld theory. If we move in the string theory moduli space to a point where the B-\nﬁelds on some 2-cycles are turned oﬀ, the D3-branes wrapped around these 2-cycles\nbecome tensionless, and the low-energy theory becomes a non-trivial N = (2, 0) six\ndimensional SCFT (see [93] and references therein).\nThe low-energy spectrum on\nAdS5 then includes the dimensional reduction of this conformal theory on a circle.

It would be interesting to verify this\nbehavior in the ﬁeld theory. Baryon-like operators also exist in these theories [359],\nwhich are similar to those which will be discussed in section 4.1.3.\nThere are various other supersymmetric orbifold backgrounds which behave simi-\nlarly to the examples we have described in detail here.\nThere are also many non-\nsupersymmetric examples [360, 361] but, as described above, their fate for ﬁnite N is\nnot clear, and we will not discuss them in detail here.\n4.1.2\nOrientifolds of AdS5 × S5\nThe discussion of the near-horizon limits of D3-branes on orientifolds is mostly similar\nto the discussion of orbifolds, except for the absence of twisted sector states (which do\nnot exist for orientifolds). We will focus here on two examples which illustrate some\nof the general properties of these backgrounds. Additional examples were discussed in\n[362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369].\nOur ﬁrst example is the near-horizon limit of D3-branes on an orientifold 3-plane.\nThe orientifold breaks the same supersymmetries as the 3-branes do, so in the near\nhorizon limit we have the full 32 supercharges corresponding to a d = 4, N = 4 SCFT.\nIn ﬂat space there are (see [370] and references therein) two types of orientifold planes\nwhich lead to diﬀerent projections on D-brane states. One type of orientifold plane\nleads to a low-energy SO(2N) N = 4 gauge theory for N D-branes on the orientifold,\nwhile the other leads to a USp(2N) N = 4 gauge theory. In the ﬁrst case we can also\nhave an additional “half D3-brane” stuck on the orientifold, leading to an SO(2N + 1)\nN = 4 gauge theory. In the near-horizon limits of branes on the orientifold we should\nbe able to ﬁnd string theory backgrounds which are dual to all of these gauge theories.\nThe near-horizon limit of these brane conﬁgurations is type IIB string theory on\nAdS5 × S5/Z2 ≡AdS5 × RP5, where the Z2 acts by identifying opposite points on\nthe S5, so there are no ﬁxed points and the space RP5 is smooth. The manifestation\nof the orientifolding in the near-horizon limit is that when a string goes around a\nnon-contractible cycle in RP5 (connecting opposite points of the S5) its orientation\nis reversed. In all the cases discussed above the string theory perturbation expansion\nhad only closed orientable surfaces, so it was a power series in g2\ns (or in 1/N2 in the\n’t Hooft limit); but in this background we can also have non-orientable closed surfaces\nwhich include crosscaps, and the perturbation expansion includes also odd powers of\ngs (or of 1/N in the ’t Hooft limit). In fact, it has long been known [37] that in the\n’t Hooft limit the SO(N) and USp(N) gauge theories give rise to Feynman diagrams\n118\n"}

In the Feynman diagram expansion\nit is well-known [371, 372] that the SO(2N) and USp(2N) theories are related by a\ntransformation taking N to (−N), which inverts the sign of all diagrams with an odd\nnumber of crosscaps in the ’t Hooft limit. Thus, we should look for a similar eﬀect in\nstring theory on AdS5×RP5. It turns out [216] that this is implemented by a “discrete\ntorsion” on RP5, corresponding to turning on a BNS−NS 2-form in the non-trivial co-\nhomology class of H3(RP5, ˜Z) = Z2. The eﬀect of turning on this “discrete torsion” is\nexactly to invert the sign of all string diagrams with an odd number of crosscaps. It is\nalso possible to turn on a similar “discrete torsion” for the RR 2-form B-ﬁeld, so there\nis a total of four diﬀerent possible string theories on AdS5 × RP5. It turns out that\nthe theory with no B-ﬁelds is equivalent to the SO(2N) N = 4 gauge theory, which\nis self-dual under the S-duality group SL(2, Z). The theory with only a non-zero BRR\nﬁeld is equivalent to the SO(2N + 1) gauge theory, while the theories with non-zero\nBNS−NS ﬁelds are equivalent to the USp(2N) gauge theory [216], and this is consistent\nwith the action of S-duality on these groups and on the 2-form B-ﬁelds (which are a\ndoublet of SL(2, Z)).\nAn interesting test of this correspondence is the matching of chiral primary ﬁelds.\nIn the supergravity limit the ﬁelds on AdS5 × RP5 are just the Z2 projection of the\nﬁelds on AdS5 × S5, including the multiplets with n = 2, 4, 6, · · · (in the notation of\nsection 3.2). This matches with almost all the chiral superﬁelds in the corresponding\ngauge theories, which are described as traces of products of the fundamental ﬁelds as\nin section 3.2, but with the trace of a product of an odd number of ﬁelds vanishing in\nthese theories from symmetry arguments. However, in the SO(2N) gauge theories (and\nnot in any of the others) there is an additional gauge invariant chiral superﬁeld, called\nthe Pfaﬃan, whose lowest component is of the form ǫa1a2···a2NφI1\na1a2φI2\na3a4 · · ·φIN\na2N−1a2N,\nwhere ai are SO(2N) indices and the Ij are (symmetric traceless) indices in the 6 of\nSU(4)R.

Anomaly matching in this background was discussed\nin [233].\nAnother interesting background is the near-horizon limit of D3-branes on an orien-\ntifold 7-plane, with 4 D7-branes coincident on the orientifold plane to ensure [373, 374]\nthat the dilaton is constant and the low-energy theory is conformal (this is the same\nas D3-branes in F-theory [375] at a D4-type singularity). The ﬁeld theory we get in\nthe near-horizon limit in this case is [376, 377] an N = 2 SQCD theory with USp(2N)\ngauge group, a hypermultiplet in the anti-symmetric representation and four hyper-\nmultiplets in the fundamental representation. In this case the orientifold action has\nﬁxed points on the S5, so the near-horizon limit is [378, 379] type IIB string theory\non AdS5 × S5/Z2 where the Z2 action has ﬁxed points on an S3 inside the S5. Thus,\nthis background includes an orientifold plane with the topology of S3 × AdS5, and the\nD7-branes stretched along the orientifold plane also remain as part of the background,\nso that the low-energy theory includes both the supergravity modes in the bulk and the\nSO(8) gauge theory on the D7-branes (which corresponds to an SO(8) global symme-\ntry in the corresponding ﬁeld theories)9. The string perturbation expansion in this case\nhas two sources of corrections of order gs, the crosscap diagram and the open string\ndisc diagram with strings ending on the D7-brane, leading to two types of corrections\nof order 1/N in the ’t Hooft limit. Again, the spectrum of operators in the ﬁeld theory\nmay be matched [379] with the spectrum of ﬁelds coming from the dimensional reduc-\ntion of the supergravity theory in the bulk and of the 7-brane theory wrapped on the\nS3. The anomalies may also be matched to the ﬁeld theory, including 1/N corrections\nto the leading large N result [232] which arise from disc and crosscap diagrams.\nBy studying other backgrounds of D3-branes with 7-branes (with or without ori-\nentifolds) one can obtain non-conformal theories which exhibit a logarithmic running\nof the coupling constant [379, 380]. For instance, by separating the D7-branes away\nfrom the orientifold plane, corresponding to giving a mass to the hypermultiplets in\nthe fundamental representation, one ﬁnds string theory solutions in which the dilaton\n9Similar backgrounds were discussed in [172].\n120\n"}

This\nagreement with the perturbative expectation, even though we are (necessarily) in a\nregime of large λ = g2\nY MN, is due to special properties of N = 2 gauge theories, which\nprevent many quantities from being renormalized beyond one-loop.\n4.1.3\nConifold theories\nIn the correspondence between string theory on AdS5 × S5 and d = 4 N = 4 SYM\ntheories, some of the most direct checks, such as protected operator dimensions and the\nfunctional form of two- and three-point functions, are determined by properties of the\nsupergroup SU(2, 2|4). Many of the normalizations of two- and three-point functions\nwhich have been computed explicitly are protected by non-renormalization theorems.\nAnd yet, we are inclined to believe that the correspondence is a fundamental dynam-\nical principle, valid independent of group theory and the special non-renormalization\nproperties of N = 4 supersymmetry.\nTo test this belief we want to consider theories with reduced supersymmetry. Orb-\nifold theories [330] provide interesting examples; however, as discussed in the previous\nsections, it has been shown [349, 350] that at large N these theories are a projection\nof N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory; in particular many of their Green’s functions are\ndictated by the Green’s functions of the N = 4 theory. The projection involved is\nonto states invariant under the group action that deﬁnes the orbifold. Intuitively, this\nsimilarity with the N = 4 theory arises because the compact part of the geometry is\nstill (almost everywhere) locally S5, just with some global identiﬁcations. Therefore,\nto make a more non-trivial test of models with reduced supersymmetry, we are more\ninterested in geometries of the form AdS5 × M5 where the compact manifold M5 is not\neven locally S5.\nIn fact, such compactiﬁcations have a long history in the supergravity literature: the\ndirect product geometry AdS5 × M5 is known as the Freund-Rubin ansatz [113]. The\ncurvature of the anti-de Sitter part of the geometry is supported by the ﬁve-form of\ntype IIB supergravity. Because this ﬁve-form is self-dual, M5 must also be an Einstein\nmanifold, but with positive cosmological constant: rescaling M5 if necessary, we can\nwrite Rαβ = 4gαβ. For simplicity, we are assuming that only the ﬁve-form and the\nmetric are involved in the solution.\nA trivial but useful observation is that ﬁve-dimensional Einstein manifolds with\nRαβ = 4gαβ are in one-to-one correspondence with Ricci-ﬂat manifolds C6 whose metric\n121\n"}

To put this belief to the test, it is natural to ask\nwhat in ﬁeld theory corresponds to non-perturbative objects, such as D-branes, in\nstring theory.\nThe answer was found in [216] for several types of wrapped branes\n(see also [293] for an independent analysis of some cases), and subsequent papers\n[392, 393, 394, 184, 395, 396, 333, 397, 359, 398, 399] have extended and elaborated\non the story.

The ﬁeld theory interpretation must be in terms\nof some vertex or operator, as for any other particle in AdS (as described above in the\ncase of supergravity particles). If the compact manifold is S5, then the only topologi-\ncally stable possibility is a wrapped 5-brane. The key observation here is that charge\nconservation requires that N strings must run into or out of the 5-brane. In the case of\na D5-brane, these N strings are fundamental strings (one could also consider SL(2, Z)\nimages of this conﬁguration). The argument is a slight variant of the ones used in the\ndiscussion of anomalous brane creation [404, 405, 406]. There are N units of ﬁve-form\n(F5) ﬂux on the S5, and the coupling\n1\n2πa∧F5 in the D5-brane world-volume translates\nthis ﬂux into N units of charge under the U(1) gauge ﬁeld a on the D5-brane. Since\nthe D5-brane spatial world-volume is closed, the total charge must be zero. A string\nrunning out of the D5-brane counts as (−1) unit of U(1) charge, hence the conclusion.\nReversing the orientation of the D5-brane changes the sign of the charge induced by\nF5, and correspondingly the N strings should run into the brane rather than out.\nIn the absence of other D-branes, the strings cannot end anywhere in AdS5, so they\nmust run out to the boundary. A string ending on the boundary is interpreted (see sec-\ntion 3.5) as an electric charge in the fundamental representation of the SU(N) gauge\ngroup: an external (non-dynamical) quark. This interpretation comes from viewing\nthe strings as running from the D5-brane to a D3-brane at inﬁnity. It was shown in\n[405] that such stretched strings have a unique ground state which is fermionic, and\nthe conclusion is that the D5-brane “baryon” is precisely an antisymmetric combina-\ntion of N fermionic fundamental string “quarks.” The gauge theory interpretation is\nclear: because the gauge group is SU(N) rather than U(N), there is a gauge-invariant\nbaryonic vertex for N external fundamental quarks. We will return to a discussion of\nbaryonic objects in section 6.2.2.\nTo obtain other types of wrapped brane objects with no spatial extent in AdS5, we\nmust turn to compact manifolds with more nontrivial homology cycles. Apart from the\nintrinsic interest of studying such objects and the gauge theories in which they occur,\nthe idea is to verify the claim that every object we can exhibit in gauge theory has a\nstringy counterpart, and vice versa.\nFollowing [216] and the discussion in section 4.1.2, we now examine wrapped branes\nin the AdS5 × RP5 geometry, which is the near-horizon geometry of D3-branes placed\non top of a Z2 orientifold three-plane (the Z2 acts as xi →−xi for the six coordinates\nperpendicular to the D3-branes). H3(RP5, Z) = Z2, and the generator of the homology\ngroup is a projective space RP3 ⊂RP5. This seems to oﬀer the possibility of wrapping\na D3-brane on a 3-cycle to get a particle in AdS5. However, there is a caveat: as argued\nin [216] the wrapping is permitted only if there is no discrete torsion for the NS and\nRR B-ﬁelds. In gauge theory terms, that amounts to saying that the corresponding\n130\n"}

A similar wrapped\n3-brane was discussed in section 4.1.3, where the 3-brane was wrapped around the\n3-cycle of T 11 (which is topologically S2 × S3).\nIt is also interesting to consider branes with spatial extent in AdS5. Strings in AdS5\nwere discussed in section 3.5. A three-brane in AdS5 (by which we mean any wrapped\nbrane with three dimensions of spatial extent in AdS5) aligned with one direction\nperpendicular to the boundary must correspond to some sort of domain wall in the\nﬁeld theory. Some examples are obvious: in AdS5 × S5, if the three-brane is a D3-\nbrane, then crossing the domain wall shifts the 5-form ﬂux and changes the gauge group\nfrom SU(N) to SU(N + 1) or SU(N −1). A less obvious example was considered in\n[216]: crossing a D5-brane or NS5-brane wrapped on some RP2 ⊂RP5 changes the\ndiscrete torsion of the RR or NS B-ﬁeld, and so one can switch between SO(N) and\nSp(N/2) gauge groups. D5-branes on homology 2-cycles of the base of conifolds and\norbifolds have also been studied [218, 383, 359, 407], and the conclusion is that they\ncorrespond to domain walls across which the rank of some factor in the product gauge\ngroup is incremented.\nAnother brane wrapping possibility is branes with two dimensions of spatial extent\nin AdS5. These become strings in the gauge theory when they are oriented with one\ndimension along the radial direction. In a particular model (an SU(N)3 gauge theory\nwhose string theory image is AdS5×S5/Z3) the authors of [359] elucidated their mean-\ning: they are strings which give rise to a monodromy for the wave-functions of particles\ntransported around them. The monodromy belongs to a discrete symmetry group of\nthe gauge theory. The familiar example of such a phenomenon is the Aharonov-Bohm\neﬀect, where the electron’s wave-function picks up a U(1) phase when it is transported\naround a tube of magnetic ﬂux. The analysis of [359] extends beyond their speciﬁc\nmodel, and applies in particular to strings in SO(N) gauge theories, with N even,\nobtained from wrapping a D3-brane on a generator of H1(RP5, Z), where the RP5 has\nno discrete torsion.\nFinally, we turn to one of the most familiar examples of a non-perturbative object\nin gauge theory: the instanton.

The result (4.26) is insensitive\nto whether the D-instanton is localized on the S5, since the ﬁeld under consideration\nis an SO(6) singlet. It is a satisfying veriﬁcation of the interpretation of the variable\nz as inverse energy scale that the position ˜z of the D-instanton translates into the size\nof the gauge theory instanton. In other words, we understand the AdS5 factor (which\nappears in the moduli space of an SU(2) instanton) as merely specifying the position\nof the D-instanton in the ﬁve-dimensional bulk theory.\nIn fact, at large N, a Yang-Mills instanton is parametrized not only by a point in\nAdS5, but also by a point in S5. The S5 emerges from keeping track of the fermionic\ninstanton zero modes properly [415]. The approach is to form a bilinear ΛAB in the zero\nmodes.

One way to break conformal\ninvariance, described in section 3.6, is to examine the theory at ﬁnite temperature.\nHowever, it is also possible to break conformal invariance while preserving Lorentz\ninvariance, by deforming the action by local operators,\nS →S + h\nZ\nd4xO(x),\n(4.30)\nfor some Lorentz scalar operator O and some coeﬃcient h.\nThe analysis of such a deformation depends on the scaling dimension ∆of the op-\nerator O 12. If ∆< 4, the eﬀect of the deformation is strong in the IR and weak in\nthe UV, and the deformation is called relevant. If ∆> 4, the deformation is called\nirrelevant, and its eﬀect becomes stronger as the energy increases. Since we generally\ndescribe ﬁeld theories by starting with some UV ﬁxed point and ﬂowing to the IR, it\ndoes not really make sense to start with a CFT and perform an irrelevant deformation,\nsince this would really require a new UV description of the theory. Thus, we will not\ndiscuss irrelevant deformations here. The last case is ∆= 4, which is called a marginal\ndeformation, and which does not break conformal invariance to leading order in the\ndeformation. Generally, even if the dimension of an operator equals 4 in some CFT,\nthis will no longer be true after deforming by the operator, and conformal invariance\nwill be broken. Such deformations can be either marginally relevant or marginally ir-\nrelevant, depending on the dimension of the operator O for ﬁnite small values of h. In\nspecial cases the dimension of the operator will remain ∆= 4 for any value of h, and\nconformal invariance will be present for any value of h.

We\nalso know that at leading order in the deformation away from this subspace, (h3 + g),\nh1 and h2 correspond to marginal operators (as described above they couple to chiral\noperators of dimension 4), while (h3 −g) couples to a non-chiral operator (in the 15\nof SU(4)R) whose dimension is corrected away from g = 0 (and seems to be large for\nlarge g2\nY MN). Thus, we see that to leading order in the deformation around the N = 4\nﬁxed line, the exactly marginal deformations are given by h1 and h2 (which are two\nparticular elements of the 100 representation). It is not known if the other deformations\nin the 45 are marginally relevant, marginally irrelevant or exactly marginal.\n4.3.4\nDeformations of String Theory on AdS5 × S5\nAs described in section 4.3.1, to analyze the deformations of section 4.3.3 in the AdS\ncontext requires ﬁnding solutions of string theory with appropriate boundary condi-\ntions.

It is clear from the identiﬁcation of the superconformal al-\ngebra in the ﬁeld theory and in the string theory that these deformations break the\nsame supersymmetries in both cases; this can also be checked explicitly (say, to leading\norder in the deformation [418, 148]) by analyzing the SUSY variations of the type IIB\nsupergravity ﬁelds. The existence of an exactly marginal deformation breaking the\nN = 4 superconformal symmetry to N = 1 superconformal symmetry suggests that\nthe theorem of [438], that forbids ﬂat space compactiﬁcations with diﬀerent amounts\nof supersymmetry from being at a ﬁnite distance from each other in the string theory\nmoduli space, is not valid in AdS compactiﬁcations [418, 148].\nSince we know little about string theory in backgrounds with RR ﬁelds, our analysis\nof such solutions is eﬀectively limited to the supergravity approximation. This already\nlimits our discussion to large λ = gsN, and it limits it further to cases where the\nsolution does not develop large curvatures in the interior. In the supergravity limit one\nwould want to ﬁnd solutions of type IIB supergravity with the boundary conditions\ndescribed above (with the rest of the ﬁelds having the same boundary conditions as in\nthe AdS5 × S5 case). Unfortunately, no such solutions are known, and they seem to\nbe rather diﬃcult to construct. There are 3 possible approaches to circumventing this\nproblem of ﬁnding exact solutions to type IIB supergravity :\n• One can try to construct solutions perturbatively in the deformation parameter,\nwhich should be easier than constructing the full exact solution. Unfortunately,\nthis approach does not make sense for the relevant deformations, since already\nat leading order in the deformation (corresponding to the linearized equations of\nmotion around the AdS5 × S5 solution) we ﬁnd that the solution (Bab ∼1/U)\ngrows to be very large in the interior, so the perturbative expansion does not make\nsense. At best one may hope to have a perturbative expansion in a parameter\nlike m/U (if m is the coeﬃcient of a relevant operator of dimension ∆= 3),\nbut this only makes sense near the boundary. On the other hand, for marginal\ndeformations, and especially for deformations that are supposed to be exactly\nmarginal, this approach makes sense. Exactly marginal deformations correspond\nto solutions which do not depend on the AdS coordinates at all, so a perturbation\nexpansion in the parameters of the deformation seems to be well-deﬁned.\nIn\npractice such a perturbation expansion is quite complicated, and can only be\ndone in the ﬁrst few orders in the deformation.

This is in fact true for any deformation in the 45. At\nthird order one probably gets non-trivial constraints on which elements of the\n45 can be turned on in an exactly marginal deformation, but the equations of\nmotion of type IIB SUGRA have not yet been expanded to this order. Verifying\nthat the deformations that are exactly marginal in the ﬁeld theory correspond\nto exactly marginal deformations also in string theory on AdS5 × S5 would be a\nnon-trivial test of the AdS/CFT correspondence.\n• There are no known non-trivial solutions of type IIB supergravity which are\nasymptotically of the form described above for the relevant or marginal deforma-\ntions. However, there are several known solutions [174, 121] of type IIB super-\ngravity (in addition to the AdS5 × S5 solution) which involve AdS5 spaces and\nhave SO(4, 2) isometries (these solutions need not necessarily be direct products\nAdS5 × X), and one can try to guess that they would be the end-points of ﬂows\narising from relevant deformations. As long as we are in the supergravity ap-\nproximation, only solutions which are topologically equivalent to AdS5 × S5 can\nbe related by ﬂows to the AdS5 × S5 solution, so we will not discuss here other\ntypes of AdS5 solutions.\nOne such solution was found in [174], which is of the form AdS5 ×X, where X is\nan S1 ﬁber over CP 2 (a “stretched ﬁve-sphere”), and there is also a 3-form ﬁeld\nturned on in the compact directions (this is called a Pope-Warner type solution\n[439]).\nThis solution has an SU(3) isometry symmetry (corresponding to an\nSU(3) global symmetry in the corresponding ﬁeld theory), and it breaks all the\nsupersymmetries. Thus, it is natural to try to identify it with the deformation by\nthe non-supersymmetric single-fermion mass operator described in section 4.3.3,\nwhich has the same symmetries. Unfortunately, as discussed below, this solution\nseems to be unstable.\nAn additional solution, found in [121], exhibits an SO(5) global symmetry.

A\nsimilar truncation is believed to exist ([140, 114] and references therein) for the\nrelation between 11 dimensional supergravity compactiﬁed on AdS4 ×S7 and the\nfour dimensional N = 8 gauged supergravity, and for the relation between 11\ndimensional supergravity compactiﬁed on AdS7 × S4 and the seven dimensional\ngauged supergravity, and the similarities between the two cases suggest that it\nmay exist also in the AdS5 × S5 case (though this has not yet been proven19).\nIn the rest of this section we will assume that such a truncation exists and see\nwhat we can learn from it.

Throughout\nthis section M4 = K3 or T 4. In this case we can get some insight on the dual confor-\nmal ﬁeld theory by deriving this duality from D-branes, as we did for the AdS5 × S5\ncase.\nWe start with type IIB string theory on M4.\nWe consider a set of Q1 D1\nbranes along a non-compact direction, and Q5 D5 branes wrapping M4 and sharing\nthe non-compact direction with the D1 branes. All the branes are coincident in the\ntransverse non-compact directions. The unbroken Lorentz symmetry of this conﬁgura-\ntion is SO(1, 1) × SO(4). SO(1, 1) corresponds to boosts along the string, and SO(4)\nis the group of rotations in the four non-compact directions transverse to both branes.\nThis conﬁguration also preserves eight supersymmetries, actually N = (4, 4) super-\nsymmetry once we decompose them into left and right moving spinors of SO(1, 1)1.\nIt is possible to ﬁnd the supergravity solution for this conﬁguration (see [448] for a\nreview) and then take the near horizon limit as we did in section 3.1 [5], and we get\nthe metric (in string frame)\nds2\nα′ =\nU2\ng6\n√Q1Q5\n(−dt2 + dx2\n1) + g6\nq\nQ1Q5\ndU2\nU2 + g6\nq\nQ1Q5dΩ2\n3.\n(5.14)\nThis is AdS3 × S3 with radius R2 = R2\nAdS = R2\nS3 = g6\n√Q1Q5l2\ns, where g6 is the\nsix dimensional string coupling. The full ten dimensional geometry also includes an\nM4 factor. In this case the volume of the M4 factor in the near-horizon geometry\nis proportional to Q1/Q5, and it is independent of the volume of the original M4\nover which we wrapped the branes. In the full D1-D5 geometry, which includes the\nasymptotically ﬂat region, the volume of M4 varies, and it is equal to the above ﬁxed\nvalue in the near horizon region [449, 450, 451, 452].\n5.3.1\nThe Conformal Field Theory\nThe dual conformal ﬁeld theory is the low energy ﬁeld theory living on the D1-D5\nsystem [453].

We can\ncalculate this central charge in a way that is not too dependent on the precise structure\nof the conformal ﬁeld theory. The conformal ﬁeld theory that we are interested in is\nthe IR ﬁxed point of the ﬁeld theory living on D1-D5 branes. The ﬁeld theory living\non D1-D5 branes, before we go to the IR ﬁxed point, is some 1 + 1 dimensional ﬁeld\ntheory with N = (4, 4) supersymmetry. This amount of supersymmetry is equivalent to\nN = 2 in four dimensions, so we can classify the multiplets in a similar fashion. There\nis a vector multiplet and a hypermultiplet. In two dimensions both multiplets have the\nsame propagating degrees of freedom, four scalars and four fermions, but they have\ndiﬀerent properties under the SU(2)L × SU(2)R global R-symmetry. Under this group\nthe scalars in the hypermultiplets are in the trivial representation, while the scalars\nin the vector multiplet are in the (2, 2). On the fermions these global symmetries\nact chirally. The left moving vector multiplet fermions are in the (1, 2), and the left\nmoving hypermultiplet fermions are in the (2, 1). The right moving fermions have\nsimilar properties with SU(2)L ↔SU(2)R. The theory can have a Coulomb branch\nwhere the scalars in the vector multiplets have expectation values, and a Higgs branch\nwhere the scalars in the hypermultiplets have expectation values.\nFrom the spacetime origin of the supercharges it is clear that the SU(2)L × SU(2)R\nglobal R-symmetry is the same as the SO(4) symmetry of spatial rotations in the 4-\nplane orthogonal to the D1-D5 system [454, 455, 456]. The vector multiplets describe\nmotion of the branes in the transverse directions, this is consistent with their SO(4)\ntransformation properties. The vector multiplet “expectation values” should be zero\nif we want the branes to be on top of each other. We have put quotation marks since\nexpectation values do not exist in a 1 + 1 dimensional ﬁeld theory. It is possible to\nshow that if Q1 and Q5 are coprime then, by turning on some of the M4 moduli (more\nprecisely some NS B-ﬁelds), one can remove the Coulomb branch altogether, forcing\nthe branes to be at the same point in the transverse directions [457, 343].\nSince the fermions transform chirally under SU(2)L, this theory has a chiral anomaly.\nThe chiral anomaly for SU(2)L is proportional to the number of left moving fermions\nminus the number of right moving fermions that transform under this symmetry. The\n’t Hooft anomaly matching conditions imply that this anomaly should be the same at\nhigh and low energies [458]. At high energies (high compared to the IR ﬁxed point)\nthe anomaly is ka = NH −NV , the diﬀerence between the number of vector multiplets\nand hypermultiplets.\nLet us now calculate this, starting with the T 4 case.\nOn a\nD1-D5 brane worldvolume there are massless excitations coming from (1,1) strings,\n(5,5) strings and (1,5) (and (5,1)) strings.\nThe (1,1) or (5,5) strings come from a\nvector multiplet of an N = (8, 8) theory, which gives rise to both a vector multiplet\nand a hypermultiplet of N = (4, 4) supersymmetry, so they do not contribute to the\nanomaly.

For the K3 case the analysis is similar.\nThe D5 branes are now wrapped on K3, so the (5,5) strings give rise only to a vector\nmultiplet. The diﬀerence from the T 4 case comes from the fact that in the T 4 case\nthe (5,5) hypermultiplet came from Wilson lines on the torus, and on K3 we do not\nhave one-cycles so we do not have Wilson lines. On the ﬁvebrane worldvolume there\nis (when it is wrapped on K3) an induced one-brane charge equal to Qind\n1\n= −Q5. The\ntotal D1 brane charge is equal to the sum of the charges carried by explicit D1 branes\nand this negative induced charge, Q1 = Qind\n1\n+ QD1\n1\n[459]. Therefore, the number of\nD1 branes is really QD1\n1\n= Q1 + Q5, and the number of (1,5) strings is QD1\n1 Q5. So,\nwe conclude that the anomaly is ka = QD1\n1 Q5 −Q2\n5 = Q1Q5, which in the end is the\nsame result as in the T 4 case. Note that in order to calculate this anomaly we only\nneed to know the massless ﬁelds, since all massive ﬁelds live in larger representations\nwhich are roughly like a vector multiplet plus a hypermultiplet, and therefore they do\nnot contribute to the anomaly.\nWhen we are on the Higgs branch all the vectors become massive except for the center\nof mass multiplet, which contains ﬁelds describing the overall motion of all the branes\nin the four transverse directions. This is just a free multiplet, containing four scalar\nﬁelds. On the Higgs branch, at the IR ﬁxed point, the SU(2)L symmetry becomes a\ncurrent algebra with an anomaly kcft. The total anomaly should be the same, so that\nka = kcft−1. The last term comes from the center of mass U(1) vector multiplet (which\nis not included in kcft). So, we conclude that kcft = Q1Q5 + 1. Since the U(1) vector\nmultiplet is decoupled, we drop it in the rest of the discussion and we talk only about\nthe conformal ﬁeld theory of the hypermultiplets.\nThe N = (4, 4) superconformal\nsymmetry relates the anomaly in the SU(2) current algebra to the central charge,\nc = 6kcft = 6(Q1Q5 + 1). Using the value for the AdS3 radius R = (g2\n6Q1Q5)1/4ls and\nthe three dimensional Newton constant G(3)\nN = g2\n6l4\ns/4R3, we can now check that (5.4)\nis satisﬁed to leading order for large k. This also ensures, as we saw above, that the\nblack hole entropy comes out right.\nNow we will try to describe this conformal ﬁeld theory a bit more explicitly. We start\nwith Q5 D5 branes, and we view the D1 branes as instantons of the low-energy SYM\ntheory on the ﬁve-branes [161]. These instantons live on M4 and are translationally\ninvariant (actually also SO(1, 1) invariant) along time and the x5 direction, where x5\nis the non compact direction along the D5 branes. See ﬁgure 5.2(a). This instanton\nconﬁguration, with instanton number Q1, has moduli, which are the parameters that\nparameterize a continuous family of solutions (classical instanton conﬁgurations). All\nof these solutions have the same energy. Small ﬂuctuations of this conﬁguration (at\nlow energies) are described by ﬂuctuations of the instanton moduli.\nThese moduli\ncan ﬂuctuate in time as well as in the x5 direction. See ﬁgure 5.2(b).

The deformation involves blowing\nup the ﬁxed points of the orbifold, as well as modifying the B-ﬁelds that live at the\norbifold point. We will discuss this in more detail later. The parameter that blows\nup the singularity can be identiﬁed with one of the supergravity moduli of this solu-\ntion. For some particular value of these moduli (which are not to be confused with\nthe moduli of the instanton conﬁguration) the CFT will be precisely the symmetric\nproduct, but at that point the gravity approximation will not be valid, since we will\nsee that the supergravity description predicts fewer states at low conformal weights\nthan the symmetric product CFT.

This should be contrasted to the AdS5×S5\ncase, where the ﬁeld theory calculation of the entropy was only done at weak coupling\n(in two dimensions the entropy is determined by the central charge and cannot change\nas we vary moduli). In [465] corrections to the central charge in the gravity picture\nwere analyzed.\nWe noticed above that the gravity description predicted a sharp phase transition\nwhen the temperature was T = 1/(2π), and we remarked that the ﬁeld theory had to\nhave some special properties to make this happen. We will now explain qualitatively\nthis phase transition. Our discussion will be qualitative because we will work at the\norbifold point, and this is not correct if we are in the supergravity regime. We will\nsee that the symmetric product has a feature that makes this sharp phase transition\npossible.\nThe orbifold theory can be interpreted in terms of a gas of strings [466, 467]. These\nare strings that wind along x5 and move on M4. The total winding number is k. The\nstrings can be singly wound or multiply wound. In the R-R sector it does not cost any\nenergy to multiply wind the strings. If we have NS-NS boundary conditions, which\nare the appropriate ones to describe AdS3, it will cost some energy to multiply wind\nthe strings. The energy cost in the orbifold CFT is the same as twice the conformal\nweight of the corresponding twist operator, which is h = ¯h = w/4 + O(1/w) for a\nconﬁguration with winding number w. If the strings are singly wound and we have a\ntemperature of order one (or 1/2π), we will not have many oscillation modes excited\non these strings, and the entropy will be small.\nNote that the fact that we have\nmany singly wound strings does not help, since we are supposed to symmetrize over\nall strings, so most of the strings will be in similar states and they will not contribute\nmuch to the entropy.\nSo, the free energy of such a state is basically F ∼0.\nOn\nthe other hand, if we multiply wind all the strings, we raise the energy of the system\nbut we also increase the entropy [468], since now the energy gap of the system will\nbe much lower (the multiply wound strings behave eﬀectively like a ﬁeld theory on\na circle with a radius which is w times bigger).

This estimate of the energy gap agrees with a\nsemiclassical estimate as follows. We can trust the thermodynamic approximation for\nblack holes as long as the speciﬁc heat is large enough [469]. For any system we need\na large speciﬁc heat, Ce ≡∂E\n∂T , in order to trust the thermodynamic approximation. In\nthis case E ∼kT 2, so the condition Ce ≫1 boils down to E ≫1/k .

The boundary condition on\nthese waves at the singularity should be such that one gets the above gap, but in the\ngravity approximation k = ∞and this gap is not seen.

Of course, these black holes\nwill preserve supersymmetry only if the boundary conditions on S1 are periodic, i.e.\nonly if we are considering the RR sector of the theory. In the RR sector it becomes more\nnatural to measure energies so that the RR vacuum has zero energy.

In the K3 case we can give a better argument. We will\nsee that all chiral primaries that appear are bosonic in nature, while we see from ﬁgure\n5.4 that we need some bosonic and some fermionic chiral primaries to make a long\nmultiplet. Therefore, all chiral primaries must remain for any value of the moduli.\n163\n"}

Since these states are protected by\nsupersymmetry we can go to the orbifold point Sym(M4)k. The chiral primaries in\nthis case can be understood as follows. In a theory with N = (4, 4) supersymmetry we\ncan do calculations in the RR sector and then translate them into results about the NS-\nNS sector. This process is called “spectral ﬂow”, and it amounts to an automorphism\nof the N = 4 algebra. Under spectral ﬂow, the chiral primaries of the NS-NS sector\n(that we are interested in) are in one to one correspondence with the ground states\nof the RR sector. It is easier to compute the properties of the RR ground states of\nthe theory. Orbifold conformal ﬁeld theories, like Sym(M4)k, can be thought of as\ndescribing a gas of strings winding on a circle, the circle where the CFT is deﬁned,\nwith total winding number k and moving on M4.\nThe ground state energies of a\nsingly wound string and a multiply wound string are the same if we are in the RR\nsector. Then, we can calculate a partition function over the RR ground states. It is\nmore convenient to relax the constraint on the total winding number by introducing\na chemical potential for the winding number, and then we can recover the result with\nﬁxed winding number by extracting the appropriate term in the partition function as in\n[466]. Since our conformal ﬁeld theory has ﬁxed k we will be implicitly assuming that\nwe are extracting the appropriate term from the partition function. The RR ground\nstates for the strings moving on M4 are the same as the ground states of a quantum\nmechanical supersymmetric sigma model on M4. It was shown by Witten [478] that\n164\n"}

Each single particle state contributes\nwith a factor (1 −yj¯y¯j)−d(j,¯j) to the partition function, were d(j,¯j) is the total number\nof single particle states with these spins.

Again, this should correspond to part of the\nphysical modes of gravity on AdS3. Pure gravity in three dimensions is a theory with\nno local degrees of freedom. In fact, it is equivalent to an SL(2, R) × SL(2, R) Chern-\nSimons theory [481, 482, 483, 484]. This gives rise to some physical degrees of freedom\nliving at the boundary. It was argued that we get a Liouville theory at the boundary\n[485, 486, 487, 488, 489], which includes a stress tensor operator. In the T 4 case we\nalso have some other special particles which correspond to fermion zero modes (1/2, 0)\nand (0, 1/2). These fermion zero modes are the supersymmetric partners of the U(1)\ncurrents associated to isometries of T 4. The six dimensional theory corresponding to\ntype IIB string theory on T 4 has 16 vector ﬁelds transforming in the spinor of SO(5, 5).\nFrom the symmetric product we get only 8 currents (4L + 4R). The other eight are\npresumably related to an extra copy of T 4 appearing in the CFT due to the Wilson\nlines of the U(1) in U(Q5) [460, 490].\nBesides these purely left-moving or purely right-moving modes, which are not so easy\nto see in supergravity, all other states arise as local bulk excitations of supergravity\nﬁelds on AdS3 and are clearly present.\nHigher values of j typically correspond to\nhigher Kaluza-Klein modes of lower j ﬁelds.\nMore precisely, we have n (1/2, 1/2)\nstates where n = h11 + 1 [278, 479, 447]. By applying Q’s, each of these states gives\nrise to four SU(2)-neutral scalar ﬁelds, which have conformal weights h = ¯h = 1.\nTherefore, they correspond to massless ﬁelds in spacetime by (3.14). These are the 4n\nmoduli of the supergravity compactiﬁcation, which are identiﬁed with the moduli of\nthe conformal ﬁeld theory. In the conformal ﬁeld theory 4h11 of them correspond to\ndeformations of each copy of M4 in the symmetric product, while the extra four are\nassociated to a blowup mode, the blowup mode of the Z2 singularity that arises when\nwe exchange two copies of M4. Next, we have n + 1 ﬁelds with quantum numbers\n(1, 1), n of these are higher order Kaluza Klein modes of the n ﬁelds we had before,\nand the new one corresponds to deformations of the S3. Each of these states gives rise\nto SU(2)-neutral ﬁelds with positive mass, since we have to apply Q’s twice and we get\nh = ¯h = 2. These are the n ﬁxed scalars of the supergravity background plus one more\nﬁeld related to changing the size of the S3. The ﬁelds with j,¯j’s above these values\nare just higher Kaluza Klein modes of the ﬁelds we have already mentioned explicitly.\nSee [278, 479, 447] for a more systematic treatment and derivation of these results.\nNow, we want to compare the supergravity result with the gauge theory results.\nIn (5.22) there is an “exclusion principle” since the total power of p has to be pk,\nthus limiting the total number of particles. In supergravity (5.24) we do not have any\nindication of this exclusion principle.

There are multi-particle states with\nj < k that are excluded from (5.22). The bounds from (5.22) appear for very large\nangular momenta and, therefore, very large energies, where we would not necessarily\ntrust the gravity approximation. In fact, the gravity result and the conformal ﬁeld\ntheory result match precisely, as long as the conformal weight or spin of the chiral\nprimaries is j,¯j ≤k/2. One can show that the gravity description exactly matches\nthe k →∞limit of (5.22) [447]. This limit is extracted from (5.22) by noticing that\nthere is a factor of (1−p) in the denominator, which is related to the identity operator.\nSo, we can extract the k →∞limit by multiplying (5.22) by (1 −p) and setting\np →1.\nIn principle, we could get precise agreement between the conformal ﬁeld\ntheory calculation and the supergravity calculation if we incorporate the exclusion\nprinciple by assigning a “degree” to each supergravity ﬁeld, as explained in [476],\nand then considering only multiparticle states with degree smaller than k. One can\nfurther wonder whether there is something special that happens at j = k/2, when the\nexclusion principle starts making a diﬀerence. Since we are considering states with\nhigh conformal weight and angular momentum it is natural to wonder whether there\nare any black hole states that could appear. There are black holes which carry angular\nmomentum on S3. These black holes are characterized by the two angular momenta\nJL, JR, of SU(2)L×SU(2)R. The minimum black hole mass for given angular momenta\nwas given in (5.17), Mmin(JL, JR) = k/2 + J2\nL/k + J2\nR/k, where we used c = 6k and\n(5.4). We see that these masses are always bigger than the mass of the chiral primary\nstates with angular momenta (JL, JR), except when JL = JR = k/2. So we see that\nsomething special is happening at j = k/2, since at this point a black hole appears\nas a chiral primary state. Connections between this exclusion principle and quantum\ngroups and non-commutative geometry were studied in [491, 492].\n5.3.4\nCalculation of the Elliptic Genus in Supergravity\nWe could now consider states which are left moving chiral primaries and anything on\nthe right moving side. These states are also in small representations, and one might\nbe tempted to compute the spectrum of chiral primaries at the orbifold point and then\ntry to match it to supergravity. However, this is not the correct thing to do, and in\nfact the spectrum does not match [493]. It is not correct because some chiral primary\nstates could pair up and become very massive non-chiral primaries. In the case of\nchiral-anything states, a useful tool to count the number of states, which gives a result\nthat is independent of the deformations of the theory, is the “elliptic genus”, which is\nthe partition function\nZk = TrRR[(−1)2j+2¯jqL0¯q\n¯L0yj].\n(5.25)\n167\n"}

This raised some doubts that (5.25) would agree with supergravity. The\nelliptic genus diverges when we take the limit k →∞. The origin of this divergence is\nthe contribution of the (2, 0) form, which is a chiral primary on the left but it carries\nzero conformal weight on the right. So, we get a contribution of order k from the fact\nthat this state could be occupied k times without changing the powers of q or y.

In the supergravity\nresult we explicitly exclude the contribution of the (2, 0) form, since it is directly related\nto the factor of k that we extracted, but we keep the contribution of the (0, 2) form and\nthe rest of the ﬁelds. The supergravity result then agrees precisely with (5.26) [476].\nBoth in the supergravity calculation and in the conformal ﬁeld theory calculation at\nthe orbifold point there are many ﬁelds of the form (chiral,anything), but most of\nthem cancel out to give (5.26). For example, we can see that the only supergravity\nsingle particle states that contribute for large powers of y>1/2 are the (chiral, chiral)\nand (chiral, antichiral) states. One can further incorporate the exclusion principle in\nsupergravity by assigning degrees to the various ﬁelds, and then one ﬁnds that the\nelliptic genus agrees up to powers of qh with h ≤(k + 1)/4 [476]. Here again this is\nthe point where a black hole starts contributing to the elliptic genus.

In the previous section we\nstarted out with type IIB string theory compactiﬁed on M4 to six dimensions. The\ntheory has many charges carried by string like objects, which come from branes wrap-\nping on various cycles of M4. These charges transform as vectors under the duality\ngroup of the theory SO(5, n), where n = 21, 5 for the K3 and T 4 cases respectively.\nThese 5 + n strings correspond to the fundamental and D strings, the NS and D ﬁve-\nbranes wrapped on M4, and to D3 branes wrapped on the n + 1 two-cycles of M4.

The\nradius of curvature of the gravity solution is proportional to q2, R4 ∼q2, where we use\nthe SO(5, n) metric. In the K3 case q2 > 0 for supersymmetric conﬁgurations. The six\ndimensional space-time theory has 5n massless scalar ﬁelds, which parameterize the\ncoset manifold SO(5, n)/SO(5) × SO(n) [494]. When we choose a particular charge\nvector, with q2 > 0, we break the duality group to SO(4, n), and out of the original 5n\nmassless scalars n becomes massive and have values determined by the charges (and\nthe other scalars) [495]. The remaining 4n scalars are massless and represent moduli\nof the supergravity compactiﬁcation and, therefore, moduli of the dual conformal ﬁeld\ntheory. Note that the conformal ﬁeld theory involves the instanton moduli space, but\nhere the word “moduli” refers to the parameters of the CFT, such as the shape of T 4,\netc.\nIf we start moving in this moduli space we sometimes ﬁnd that the gravity solution\nis best described by doing duality transformations [457, 343]. One interesting region\nin moduli space is when the system is best described in terms of a system of NS\nﬁvebranes and fundamental strings. This is the S-dual version of the D1-D5 system\nthat we were considering above. In this NS background the radius of the S3 and of AdS3\nis R2 = Q5α′, and it is independent of Q1. Actually, Q1 only enters through the six\ndimensional string coupling, which in this case is a ﬁxed scalar g2\n6 = Q5/Q1. The volume\nof M4 is a free scalar in this case. The advantage of this background is that one can solve\nstring theory on it to all orders in α′, since it is a WZW model, actually an SL(2, R) ×\nSU(2) WZW model. String propagation in SL(2, R) WZW models were studied in\n[496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513,\n514, 515, 516]. Thus, in this case we can also consider states corresponding to massive\nstring modes, etc. We can also deﬁne the spacetime Virasoro generators in the full\nstring theory, and check that they act on string states as they should [509, 510, 511]5. In\nthe string theory description the Virasoro symmetry appears directly in the formalism\nas a spacetime symmetry. One can also study D-branes in these AdS3 backgrounds\n[519]. Conditions for spacetime supersymmetry for string theory on SL(2, R) WZW\nbackgrounds were studied in [520, 521]. In the D1-D5 conﬁguration it is much harder\nto solve string theory, since RR backgrounds are involved. Classical actions for strings\non these backgrounds were written in [522, 523, 524]. However, a formulation of string\ntheory on these backgrounds was proposed in [525] (see also [526, 521, 527]).\nFor\nsome values of the moduli the CFT is singular. What this means is that we will have\na continuum of states in the cylinder picture. In the picture with NS charges this\nhappens, for example, when all RR B-ﬁelds on M4 are zero. This continuum of states\ncomes from fundamental strings stretching close to the boundary of AdS3. These states\n5Conﬁgurations with NS ﬂuxes that lead to AdS2d+1 spaces where studied in [517].

This preserves N = (4, 0) supersymmetry. This quotient changes the\ncentral charge of the theory by a factor of N through (5.4) (since the volume of the S3\nis smaller by a factor of N). It is also possible to obtain this geometry by considering\nthe near horizon behavior of a D1-D5 + KK monopole system, or equivalently a D1-D5\nsystem near an AN singularity. It is possible to analyze the ﬁeld theory by using the\nmethods in [344], and using the above anomaly argument one can calculate the right\nmoving central charge. The left moving central charge should be calculated by a more\ndetailed argument. When we have NS 5 branes and fundamental strings on an AN\nsingularity, the worldsheet theory is solvable, and one can calculate the spectrum of\nmassive string states, etc. [528]. One can also consider also both RR and NS ﬂuxes\nsimultaneously [529]. Other papers analyzing aspects of these quotients or orbifolds\nare [530, 530, 531, 532, 533].\nA related conﬁguration arises if we consider M-theory on M6, where M6 = T 6, T 2 ×\nK3 or CY3, and we wrap M5 branes on a four-cycle in M6 with non-vanishing triple\nself-intersection number. Then, we get a string in ﬁve dimensions, and the near horizon\ngeometry of the supergravity solution is AdS3 × S2 × M6\nf , where the subscript on M6\nf\nindicates that the vector moduli of M6 are ﬁxed scalars. In this case we get again\nan N = (0, 4) theory, and the SU(2)R symmetry is associated to rotations of the\nsphere. It is possible to calculate the central charge by counting the number of moduli\nof the brane conﬁguration. Some of the moduli correspond to geometric deformations\nand some of them correspond to B-ﬁelds on the ﬁvebrane worldvolume [534, 535]. A\nsupergravity analysis of this compactiﬁcation was done in [447, 536].\nAnother interesting case is string theory compactiﬁed on AdS3 ×S3 ×S3 ×S1, which\nhas a large N = 4 symmetry [537, 538, 539]. This algebra is sometimes called Aγ. It\nincludes an SU(2)k × SU(2)k′ × U(1) current algebra. The relative sizes of the levels\nof the two SU(2) factors are related to the relative sizes of the radii of the spheres.\nThis case seems to be conceptually simpler than the case with an M4, since all the\nspacetime dimensions are associated to a symmetry of the system6. In [537] a geometry\nlike this was obtained from branes, except that the S1 was replaced by R, and it is not\nclear which brane conﬁguration gives the geometry with the S1. This makes it more\ndiﬃcult to guess the dual conformal ﬁeld theory. In [538] a CFT dual was proposed\nfor this system in the case that k = k′.

The N = (0, 4) theory on the D1 brane worldvolume theory encodes\nin the Yukawa couplings the ADHM data for the construction of the moduli space of\ninstantons [543, 544]. What distinguishes the Type I system from the Type IIB case is\nthe SO(32) gauge group in the open string sector.

In higher dimensions this is not possible since pure gravity is not renormal-\nizable, so the only known sensible quantum gravity theory is string theory, but in\nthree dimensions gravity can be rewritten as a Chern-Simons theory [483, 484], and\nthis theory is renormalizable. Gravity in three dimensions has no dynamical degrees\nof freedom.\nWe have seen, nevertheless, that it has black hole solutions when we\nconsider gravity with a negative cosmological constant [442] (5.8). So, it should at\nleast describe the dynamics of these black holes, black hole collisions, etc. It has been\nargued that this Chern-Simons theory reduces to a Liouville theory at the boundary\n[485, 487, 488, 546], with the right central charge (5.4). Naively, using the Cardy for-\nmula, this Liouville theory does not seem to give the same entropy as the black holes,\nbut the Cardy formula does not hold in this case (Liouville theory does not satisfy the\nassumptions that go into the Cardy formula). Hopefully, these problems will be solved\nonce it is understood how to properly quantize Liouville theory. Since we have the\nright central charge it seems that we should be able to calculate the BTZ black hole\nentropy [446], but Liouville theory is very peculiar and the entropy seems smaller [547].\nOther papers studying AdS pure gravity or BTZ black holes in pure gravity include\n[548, 286, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564,\n171\n"}

The average over initial states is\nessentially an average over a thermal ensemble, since the number of states is very large\nso the microcanonical ensemble is the same as a thermal ensemble. So, the ﬁnal result\nis that we have to compute the two point function of the corresponding operator over a\nthermal ensemble. This essentially translates into computing the correlation function\non the Euclidean cylinder, and the result is proportional to (5.40) [16, 575, 574]. This\nargument reproduces the functional dependence on ω of (5.40). For other ﬁelds (non-\nminimally coupled) the functional dependence on ω is determined just in terms of the\nconformal weight of the associated operator.\nLet us emphasize that the matching procedure (5.38) is valid only in the low energy\nregime (5.36). In this regime the typical gravitational size of the conﬁguration, which\nis of order r5, is much smaller than the Compton wavelength of the particle. See ﬁgure\n1.4. In fact, note that in the connecting region r ∼r5 the function φ does not vary very\nmuch. Let us see this more explicitly. We see from (5.37) that we can approximate the\nequation by something like ω2r2\n5φ + φ′′ = 0. From (5.36) we see that the variation of φ\nis very small over this connecting region. Furthermore, since absorption will turn out\nto be small, we can approximate the value of φ at the origin by the value it has in ﬂat\nspace. So, we can directly match the values of φ at the origin for a wave propagating\nin ﬂat space with the value of φ near the boundary of AdS3.\n175\n"}

We ﬁrst notice\nthat the moduli space of minimally coupled scalars in supergravity is SO(4, 5)/SO(4)×\nSO(5).

Since the conformal ﬁeld theory has N = (4, 4)\nsupersymmetry, this metric is highly constrained. In fact, it was shown in [576] that it\nis the homogeneous metric on SO(4, 5)/SO(4) × SO(5) (up to global identiﬁcations).\nSince the CFT moduli space is the same as the supergravity moduli space, the two\nmetrics could diﬀer only by an overall numerical factor Gab = Dgab, where D is a\nnumber. In order to compute this number we can go to a point in moduli space where\nthe CFT is just the orbifold Sym(T 4)k. This point corresponds to having a single D5\nbrane and k = Q5Q1 D1 branes. We can also choose the string coupling to be arbitrarily\nsmall. For example, we can choose the scalar φ to be an oﬀ-diagonal component of the\nmetric on T 4. The absorption cross section calculation then reduces to the one done in\n[16], which we now review.

The leading factor\nof 2 in the equation for Γ(k0) in (5.47) is there because there are two distinguishable\nﬁnal states that can come out of a given h12 initial state: an X1 boson moving left\nand an X2 boson moving right, or X1 moving right and X2 moving left.

Finally, we should remark\nthat this calculation implies that the metric on the moduli space of the CFT has\nan overall factor of k = Q1Q5 as compared with the metric that appears in the six\ndimensional gravity action (5.43). This blends in perfectly with the expectations from\nAdS3/CFT2, since in the AdS3 region, by the time we go down to three dimensions, we\nget factors of the volume of the S3 and the radius of AdS3 which produce the correct\nfactor of k in the gravity answer for the metric on the moduli space.\nOf course, this absorption cross section calculation is also related to the time reversed\nprocess of Hawking emission. Indeed, the Hawking radiation rates calculated in gravity\nand in the conformal ﬁeld theory coincide.\nMany other greybody factors were calculated and compared with the ﬁeld theory\npredictions [17, 573, 577, 578, 579, 574, 580, 66, 581, 582, 583, 584, 585, 586, 73, 587,\n588, 589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594, 595].

When all three\ncharges are nonzero, the surface r = 0 is a smooth inner horizon. This is analogous to\nthe situation in four dimensions with four charges [598, 599].\nThe mass, entropy and temperature of this solution are the same as those calculated\nabove for the black string (5.30)(5.31)(5.32). It is interesting to take the extremal limit\nr0 →0 with r0eγ, r0eα, r0eσ ﬁnite and nonzero.

For large N, the k = 2 scalar ﬁeld with ∆= 4 is\nthe only relevant deformation of the SCFT and it breaks the supersymmetry. All the\nnon-chiral ﬁelds appear to have large masses in the large N limit, implying that the\ncorresponding operators have large dimensions in the ﬁeld theory.\nThe spectrum includes also a family of spin one Kaluza-Klein excitations that couple\nto 1-form operators of the SCFT. The massless vectors in this family couple to the\ndimension ﬁve R-symmetry currents of the SCFT. The massless graviton couples to\nthe stress-energy tensor of the SCFT.

For each value of (large enough) k, the SUSY multiplets include one ﬁeld\nin each tower of Kaluza-Klein states. Its SO(5) representation is determined by the\nrepresentation of the scalar ﬁeld.\nFor instance, the R-symmetry currents and the\nenergy-momentum tensor are in the same supersymmetry multiplet as the scalar ﬁeld\ncorresponding to k = 2 in equation (6.2).\nAs we did for the D3 branes in section 4.1, we can place the M5 branes at singularities\nand obtain other dual models.

The dimension of this operator\nis ∆= 2N.\nTo leading order in 1/N the correlation functions of the other chiral\noperators are similar to those of the AN−1 SCFT. The DN theories also have a DLCQ\nMatrix description as quantum mechanics on the moduli space of DN instantons [601].\nThis moduli space is singular. One would expect to associate the spectrum of chiral\nprimary operators with the cohomology with compact support of some resolution of\nthis space, but such a resolution has not been constructed yet.\nA diﬀerent example is the (1, 0) six dimensional SCFT with E8 global symmetry,\nwhich is realized on the worldvolume of M5 branes placed on top of the nine brane in\nthe Hoˇrava-Witten [609] compactiﬁcation of M theory on R10×S1/Z2. The conjectured\ndual description is in terms of M theory on AdS7 × S4/Z2 [610]. The Z2 action has a\nﬁxed locus AdS7×S3 on which a ten dimensional N = 1 E8 vector multiplet propagates.\nThe chiral operators fall into short representations of the supergroup OSp(6, 2|2). In\n[611] E8 neutral and charged operators of the (1, 0) theory were matched with Kaluza-\nKlein modes of bulk ﬁelds and ﬁelds living on the singular locus, respectively.\nCorrelation functions of chiral primary operators of the large N (2, 0) theory can\nbe computed by solving classical diﬀerential equations for the supergravity ﬁelds that\ncorrespond to the ﬁeld theory operators. Two and three point functions of the chiral\nprimary operators have been computed in [612].\nThe (2, 0) SCFT has Wilson surface observables [613], which are generalizations\nof the operator given by W(Σ) = exp(i\nR\nΣ Bµνdσµν) in the theory of a free tensor\nmultiplet, where Σ is a two dimensional surface. A prescription for computing the\nWilson surface in the dual M theory picture has been given in [294].\nIt amounts,\nin the supergravity approximation, to the computation of the minimal volume of a\nmembrane bounded at the boundary of AdS7 by Σ. The reasoning is analogous to that\ndiscussed in section 3.5, but here instead of the strings stretched between D-branes,\nM2 branes are stretched between M5 branes. Such an M2 brane behaves as a string on\nthe M5 branes worldvolume, with a tension proportional to the distance between the\nM5 branes. By separating one M5 brane from N M5 branes this string can be used\nas a probe of the SCFT on the worldvolume of the N M5 branes, analogous to the\nexternal quarks discussed in section 3.5.

At energies lower than the inverse size of the manifolds, the low-energy eﬀective\ndescription is in terms of four dimensional SU(N) gauge theories. The two dimensional\nmanifold and its embedding in eleven dimensions determine the amount of supersym-\nmetry of the gauge theory. The simplest case is a wrapping on T 2 which preserves all the\nsupersymmetry. This results in the N = 4 SU(N) SCFT, with the complex gauge cou-\npling being the complex structure τ of the torus. In general, when the two dimensional\nmanifold is a holomorphic curve (Riemann surface), called a supersymmetric cycle, the\nfour dimensional theory is supersymmetric. For N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theo-\nries the Riemann surface is the Seiberg-Witten curve and its period matrix gives the\nlow energy holomorphic gauge couplings τij (i, j = 1, · · · , N −1) [614, 615, 616, 353].\nFor N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories the Riemann surface has genus zero and it\nencodes holomorphic properties of the supersymmetric gauge theory, namely the struc-\nture of its moduli space of vacua [617]. For a generic real two dimensional manifold\nthe four dimensional theory is not supersymmetric. Some qualitative properties of the\nQCD string [618] and the θ vacua follow from the wrapping procedure. Of course,\nin the non-supersymmetric cases the subtle issue of stability has to be addressed as\ndiscussed in section 4.1. In general it is not known how to compute the near-horizon\nlimit of 5-branes wrapped on a general manifold.

When\nu ≫N/g2/3\nY M the curvature of the eleven dimensional space vanishes and, unlike the\nlower dimensional branes, there does not not exist a seven dimensional ﬁeld theory\nthat describes the UV. In fact, the D6 brane worldvolume theory does not decouple\nfrom the bulk.\nA simple way to see that the D6 brane worldvolume theory does not decouple from\nthe bulk is to note that now in the decoupling limit we keep g2\nY M ∼gsl3\ns ﬁxed. When\nwe lift the D6 branes solution to M theory, this means that the eleven dimensional\nPlanck length l3\np = gsl3\ns remains ﬁxed, and therefore gravity does not decouple. An-\nother way to see that gravity does not decouple is to consider the system of D6 branes at\nﬁnite temperature in the decoupling limit. For large energy densities above extremal-\nity, E/V ≫N/l7\np, we need the eleven dimensional description. This is given by an\nuncharged Schwarzschild black hole at the ALE singularity.

For smaller\nloops the computation fails because we go into the perturbative regime, where the\npotential becomes logarithmic. For larger loops we get into the AdS4 × S7 region.\nOther works on Dp branes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence are [650,\n648, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657].\n191\n"}

Like the Dp branes, they are BPS objects that preserve half of\nthe supersymmetry of Type II theories.\nA fundamental string propagating in the\nbackground of N parallel NS5 branes is described far from the branes by a conformal\nﬁeld theory with non trivial metric, B ﬁeld and dilaton, constructed in [658]. The\nstring coupling grows as the string approaches the NS5 branes. At low energies the six\ndimensional theory on the worldvolume of N Type IIB NS5 branes is a U(N) N = (1, 1)\nsuper Yang-Mills theory, which is free in the IR. However, it is an interacting theory\nat intermediate energies. At low energies the theory on the worldvolume of N Type\nIIA NS5 branes is the AN−1 (2, 0) SCFT discussed above.\nThe six dimensional theories on the worldvolume of NS5 branes of Type II string\ntheories were argued [659] to decouple from the bulk in the limit\ngs →0,\nls = fixed .\n(6.20)\nThis is because the eﬀective coupling on the NS5 branes (e.g. the low-energy Yang-Mills\ncoupling in the type IIB case) is 1/ls, while the coupling to the bulk modes goes like\ngs. However, the computation of [660] showed that in this limit there is still Hawking\nradiation to the tube region of the NS5 brane solution, suggesting a non decoupling\nof the worldvolume theory from the bulk. In the spirit of the other correspondences\ndiscussed previously, one can reconcile the two by conjecturing [215] that string or M\ntheory in the NS5 brane background in the limit (6.20), which includes the tube region,\nis dual to the decoupled NS5 brane worldvolume theory (“little string theory”). In\nparticular, the ﬁelds in the tube which are excited in the Hawking radiation correspond\nto objects in the decoupled NS5 brane theory. In the following we will mainly discuss\nthe Type IIA NS5 brane theory3.\nThe Type IIA NS5 brane may be considered as the M5 brane localized on the eleven\ndimensional circle. Therefore its metric is that of an M5 brane at a point on a transverse\ncircle. In such a conﬁguration the near horizon metric of N NS5 branes can be written\nas [647, 215]\nds2\n=\nl2\np\n \nf −1/3(−dt2 +\n5\nX\ni=1\ndx2\ni ) + f 2/3(dx2\n11 + du2 + u2dΩ2\n3)\n!\n,\nf\n=\n∞\nX\nn=−∞\nπN\n(u2 + (x11 −2πn/l2\ns)2)3/2 .\n(6.21)\nThe x11 coordinate is periodic and has been rescaled by l3\np (x11 ≡x11 + 2π/l2\ns).

This reduces to the\nconjectured duality between M theory on AdS7 × S4 and the (2, 0) SCFT, discussed\npreviously. However, the NS5 brane theory is not a local quantum ﬁeld theory at all\nenergy scales since at short distances it is not described by a UV ﬁxed point. To see\nthis one can take ls to inﬁnity (or u to inﬁnity) in (6.21) and get a Type IIA background\nwith a linear dilaton. It has the topology of R1,5 × R × S3 with g2\ns(φ) = e−2φ/ls\n√\nN,\nwhere φ is the R coordinate.\nThis is in accord with the fact that the NS5 brane\ntheory exhibits a T-duality property upon compactiﬁcation on tori (note that in this\nbackground a ﬁnite radius in ﬁeld theory units corresponds to a ﬁnite radius in string\ntheory units on the string theory side of the correspondence, unlike the previous cases\nwe discussed).\nThe NS5 brane theories have an A-D-E classiﬁcation. This can be seen by viewing\nthem as Type II string theory on K3 with A-D-E singularities in the decoupling limit\n(6.20). The NS5 brane theories have an SO(4) R-symmetry which we identify with\nthe SO(4) isometry of S3. The IIA NS5 brane theories have a moduli space of vacua\nof the form (R4 × S1)r/W where r is the rank of the A-D-E gauge group and W\nis the corresponding Weyl group.\nIt is parametrized by the W-invariant products\nof the 5r scalars in the r tensor multiplets. They fall into short representations of\nthe supersymmetry algebra.\nWe can match these chiral operators with the string\nexcitations in the linear dilaton geometry describing the large u region of (6.21). The\nstring excitations, in short representations of the supersymmetry algebra, in the linear\ndilaton geometry were analyzed in [215]. Indeed, they match the spectrum of the chiral\noperators in short representations of the NS5 brane theories. Actually, due to the fact\nthat the string coupling goes to zero at the boundary of the linear dilaton solution, one\ncan compute here the precise spectrum of chiral ﬁelds in the string theory, and ﬁnd an\nagreement with the ﬁeld theory even for ﬁnite N (stronger than the large N agreement\nthat we described in section 3.2).\nAs in the dualities with local quantum ﬁeld theories, also here one can compute\ncorrelation functions by solving diﬀerential equations on the NS5 branes background\n(6.21). Since in this case the boundary is inﬁnitely far away, it is more natural to\ncompute correlation functions in momentum space, which correspond to the S-matrix\nin the background (6.21). The computation of two point functions of a scalar ﬁeld\nwas sketched in [215] and described more rigorously in [662]. The NS5 brane theories\nare non-local, and this causes some diﬀerences in the matching between M theory and\nthe non-gravitational NS5 brane theory in this case. One diﬀerence from the previous\ncases we discussed is that in the linear dilaton backgrounds if we put a cutoﬀat some\nvalue of the radial coordinate (generalizing the discussion of [175] which we reviewed in\n193\n"}

Of particular interest are non supersymmetric gauge theories that exhibit\nasymptotic freedom and conﬁnement. In this section, we will discuss an approach to\nstudying pure (without matter ﬁelds) QCDp in p dimensions using a dual superstring\ndescription. We will be discussing mainly the cases p = 3, 4.\nThe approach proposed by Witten [185] was to start with a maximally supersym-\nmetric gauge theory on the p + 1 dimensional worldvolume of N Dp branes. One then\ncompactiﬁes the supersymmetric theory on a circle of radius R0 and imposes anti-\nperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions around the circle. Since the fermions do\nnot have zero frequency modes around the circle they acquire a mass mf ∼1/R0. The\nscalars then acquire a mass from loop diagrams, and at energies much below 1/R0 they\ndecouple from the system. The expected eﬀective theory at large distances compared\nto the radius of the circle is pure QCD in p dimensions. Note that a similar approach\nwas discussed in the treatment of gauge theories at ﬁnite temperature T in section\n3.6, where the radius of the circle is proportional to 1/T. The high temperature limit\nof the supersymmetric gauge theory in p + 1 dimensions is thus described by a non\nsupersymmetric gauge theory in p dimensions.\nThe main obstacle to the analysis is clear from the discussions of the duality between\nstring theory and quantum ﬁeld theories in the previous sections. The string approach\nto weakly coupled gauge theories is not yet developed. Most of the available tools\nare applicable in the supergravity limit that describes the gauge theory with a large\nnumber of colors and large ’t Hooft parameter. In this regime we cannot really learn\ndirectly about QCD, since the typical scale of candidate QCD states (glueballs) is\nof the same order of magnitude (for QCD4, or a larger scale for QCD3) as the scale\n1/R0 of the mass of the “extra” scalars and fermions.\nA related issue is that at\nshort distances asymptotically free gauge theories are weakly coupled and the dual\nsupergravity description is not valid. Therefore, we will be limited to a discussion in\nthe strong coupling region of the gauge theories and in particular we will not be able\nto exhibit asymptotic freedom.\n194\n"}

However, there is also a possibility that the gauge description is valid for weak\ncoupling and the string theory description is valid for strong coupling with no smooth\ncrossover between the two descriptions. In such a scenario there is a phase transition\nat λ = λc [315, 316]. This will prevent us from using the string description to study\nQCD, and will prevent classical string theory from being the master ﬁeld for large N\nQCD.\nIn the last part of this section we will brieﬂy discuss another approach, based on a\nsuggestion by Polyakov [48], to study non supersymmetric gauge theories via a non su-\npersymmetric string description. In this approach one can exhibit asymptotic freedom\nqualitatively already in the gravity description. In the IR there are gravity solutions\nthat exhibit conﬁnement at large distances as well as strongly coupled ﬁxed points.\n6.2.1\nQCD3\nThe starting point for studying QCD3 is the N = 4 superconformal SU(N) gauge the-\nory in four dimensions which is realized as the low energy eﬀective theory of N coincid-\ning parallel D3 branes. As outlined above, the three-dimensional non-supersymmetric\ntheory is constructed by compactifying this theory on R3×S1 with anti-periodic bound-\nary conditions for the fermions around the circle. The boundary conditions break su-\npersymmetry explicitly and as the radius R0 of the circle becomes small, the fermions\ndecouple from the system since there are no zero frequency modes. The scalar ﬁelds\nin the four dimensional theory will acquire masses at one-loop, since supersymmetry is\nbroken, and these masses become inﬁnite as R0 →0. Therefore in the infrared we are\nleft with only the gauge ﬁeld degrees of freedom and the theory should be eﬀectively\nthe same as pure QCD3.\nWe will now carry out the same procedure in the dual superstring (supergravity)\npicture. As has been extensively discussed in the previous sections, the N = 4 theory\non R4 is conjectured to be dual to type IIB superstring theory on AdS5 × S5 with the\nmetric (3.5) or (3.6).\nRecall that the dimensionless gauge coupling constant g4 of the N = 4 theory is\nrelated to the string coupling constant gs as g2\n4 ≃gs. In the ’t Hooft limit, N →∞\nwith g2\n4N ≃gsN ﬁxed, the string coupling constant vanishes, gs →0.

This is qualitatively similar to what happens in strong coupling\nlattice QCD with lattice spacing a. As we will discuss in the next section, in the strong\ncoupling lattice QCD description the lowest masses of glueballs are proportional to 1/a.\nNote that in a stringy description of QCD we would expect the glueballs to correspond\nto string excitations, which are expected to have masses of order σ1/2. Therefore in the\nsupergravity limit, gsN ≫1, the glueballs that correspond to the string excitations\nare much heavier than the “supergravity glueballs” which we analyzed.\nThe natural scale for the glueball masses of continuum QCD3 is g2\n3N.

In this limit\nthe background is singular and we have to use the string theory description, which\nwe lack. We can compute the subleading correction in the strong coupling expansion\nto the masses.

Based on this metric the corrections to the masses c1 have been computed in\n[672]. While these corrections signiﬁcantly change the glueball masses, the corrections\nto the mass ratios turn out to be relatively small.\nLattice computations may exhibit lattice artifacts due to the ﬁnite lattice spacing.\nRemoving them amounts to taking a suﬃciently small lattice spacing such that eﬀec-\ntively the right physics of the continuum is captured. Getting close to the continuum\nmeans, in particular, that deviations from Lorentz invariance are minimized.\nAnalogous “artifacts” are seen in the dual supergravity description.

In section 6.2.3 we will use an analogy with lattice ﬁeld theory to\nimprove on our supergravity description and remove some of the Kaluza-Klein modes.\n6.2.2\nQCD4\nOne starting point for obtaining QCD4 is the (2, 0) superconformal theory in six dimen-\nsions realized on N parallel coinciding M5-branes, which was discussed in section 6.1.\nThe compactiﬁcation of this theory on a circle of radius R1 gives a ﬁve-dimensional the-\nory whose low-energy eﬀective theory is the maximally supersymmetric SU(N) gauge\ntheory, with a gauge coupling constant g2\n5 = 2πR1. To obtain QCD4, one compactiﬁes\nthis theory further on another S1 of radius R0. The dimensionless gauge coupling con-\nstant g4 in four dimensions is given by g2\n4 = g2\n5/(2πR0) = R1/R0. As in the previous\ncase, to break supersymmetry one imposes the anti-periodic boundary condition on the\nfermions around the second S1. And, as in the previous case, to really get QCD4 we\nneed to require that the typical mass scale of QCD states, ΛQCD, will be much smaller\nthan the other mass scales in our construction (1/R1 and 1/R0), and this will require\ngoing beyond the supergravity approximation. However, one can hope that the theory\nobtained from the supergravity limit will be in the same universality class as QCD4,\nand we will give some evidence for this.\nAs discussed in section 6.1, the large N limit of the six-dimensional theory is M\ntheory on AdS7 × S4. Upon compactiﬁcation on the two circles and imposing anti-\nperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions on the second S1, we get M theory on\na black hole background [185]. Taking the large N limit while keeping the ’t Hooft\nparameter 2πλ = g2\n4N ﬁnite requires R1 ≪R0. We can now use the duality between\nM theory on a circle and Type IIA string theory, and the M5 brane wrapping on the\nS1 of radius R1 becomes a D4 brane.

The six scalars are the components of the gauge ﬁelds in the re-\nduced dimensions. The classical theory has an SO(6) global symmetry that rotates\nthe six scalars.\nThis allows several possible parameters (from the point of view of\nrenormalizable ﬁeld theory) : a gauge coupling gY M, a mass parameter for the scalars\nm and various scalar quartic potential couplings gi, one of which appears in the clas-\nsical Lagrangian. In the classical worldvolume action, the mass parameter is zero and\nthe gi are ﬁxed in terms of gY M, it is just the dimensional reduction of the ten dimen-\nsional bosonic Yang-Mills theory. Quantum mechanically, the parameters are corrected\ndiﬀerently and can take independent values. The theory has a phase diagram depend-\ning on these parameters.

Some correspond to baryons in the ﬁeld theory,\nothers to various defects like domain walls, etc. In the AdS5 case D-instantons in the\nstring theory correspond to gauge theory instantons in the ﬁeld theory.\nIn general, the large N limit of a gauge theory should have a string theory descrip-\ntion. Whether it also has a gravity description depends on how large the curvatures\nin this string theory are. If the curvatures are small, we can have an approximate\nclassical gravity description. Otherwise, we should consider all string modes on the\nsame footing. This involves solving the worldsheet theories for strings in Ramond-\nRamond backgrounds. This is a problem that only now is beginning to be elucidated\n[525, 714, 715, 716, 717, 718, 719, 720, 721]. For non-supersymmetric QCD, or other\ntheories which are weakly coupled (as QCD is at high energies), we expect to have\ncurvatures at least of the order of the string scale, so that a proper understanding of\nstrings on highly curved spaces seems crucial.\nIt is also possible to deform the N = 4 ﬁeld theory, breaking supersymmetry and\nconformal invariance, by giving a mass to the fermions or by compactifying the theory\non a circle with supersymmetry breaking boundary conditions. Then, we have a theory\nthat should describe pure Yang-Mills theory at low energies (sections 4.3, 3.6, 6.2). In\nthe case of ﬁeld theories compactiﬁed on a circle with supersymmetry breaking bound-\nary conditions and large g2\nY MN at the compactiﬁcation scale, one can show that the\ntheory is conﬁning, has a mass gap, has θ-vacua with the right qualitative properties\nand has a conﬁnement-deconﬁnement transition at ﬁnite temperature. However, in the\nregime where the analysis can be done (small curvature) this theory includes many\nadditional degrees of freedom beyond those in the standard bosonic Yang-Mills the-\nory. In order to do quantitative calculations in bosonic Yang-Mills one would have to\ndo calculations when the curvatures are large, which goes beyond the gravity approx-\nimation and requires understanding the propagation of strings in Ramond-Ramond\nbackgrounds. Unfortunately, this is proving to be very diﬃcult, and so far we have not\nobtained new results in QCD from the correspondence. As discussed in section 6.2,\nthe gravity approximation resembles the strong coupling lattice QCD description [664],\nwhere the α′ expansion of string theory corresponds to the strong coupling expansion.\nThe gravity description has an advantage over the strong coupling lattice QCD de-\nscription by being fully Lorentz invariant. This allows, for instance, the analysis of\ntopological properties of the vacuum which is a diﬃcult task in the lattice description.\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence does provide direct evidence that QCD is describable\nas some sort of string theory (to the extent that we can use the name string theory for\nstrings propagating on spaces whose radius of curvature is of the order of the string\nscale or smaller).\nOne of the surprising things we learned about ﬁeld theory is that there are various\n224\n"}

For instance, we can take\nN →∞keeping gY M ﬁxed, and the AdS/CFT correspondence implies that many\nproperties of the ﬁeld theory (like correlation functions of chiral primary operators)\nhave a reasonable limiting behavior in this limit, though there is no good ﬁeld theory\nargument for this. Similarly, we ﬁnd that there exist large N limits for theories which\nare not gauge theories, like the d = 3, N = 8 and d = 6, N = (2, 0) superconformal\nﬁeld theories, and for various theories with less supersymmetry. The existence of these\nlimits cannot be derived directly in ﬁeld theory.\nThe correspondence has also been used to learn about the properties of ﬁeld theories\nwhich were previously only poorly understood. For instance, it has been used [343] to\nunderstand properties of two dimensional ﬁeld theories with singular target spaces, and\nto learn properties of “little string theories”, like the fact that they have a Hagedorn\nbehavior at high energies. The correspondence has also been used to construct many\nnew conformal ﬁeld theories, both in the large N limit and at ﬁnite N.\nAnother interesting case is topological Chern-Simons theory in three dimensions,\nwhich is related to a topological string theory in six dimensions [329]. In this case one\ncan solve exactly both sides of the correspondence and see explicitly that it works.\nThe correspondence is also useful for studying non-conformal gauge theories, as we\ndiscussed in section 6.1.3. A particularly interesting case is the maximally supersym-\nmetric quantum mechanical SU(N) gauge theory, which is related to Matrix theory\n[26, 722, 723, 647, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728, 729, 730].\nFrom the quantum gravity point of view we have now an explicit holographic de-\nscription for gravity in many backgrounds involving an asymptotically AdS space. The\nﬁeld theory eﬀectively sums over all geometries which are asymptotic to AdS. This\ndeﬁnes the theory non-perturbatively. This also implies that gravity in these spaces is\nunitary, giving the ﬁrst explicit non-perturbative construction of a unitary theory of\nquantum gravity,1 albeit in a curved space background. Black holes are some mixed\nstates in the ﬁeld theory Hilbert space. Explicit microscopic calculations of black hole\nentropy and greybody factors can be done in the AdS3 case (chapter 5).\nBasic properties of quantum gravity, such as approximate causality and locality at\nlow energies, are far from clear in this description [181, 279, 171, 179, 177, 731, 182],\nand it would be interesting to understand them better. We are also still far from having\na precise mapping between general conﬁgurations in the gravitational theory and in\nthe ﬁeld theory (see [732, 178] for some attempts to go in this direction).\nIn principle one can extract the physics of quantum gravity in ﬂat space by taking\nthe large radius limit of physics in AdS space. Since we have not discussed this yet\n1In the context of Matrix theory [26] we need to take a large N limit which is not well understood\nin order to describe a theory of gravity in a space with no closed light-like curves.\n225\n"}

We would like to be able to describe processes in ﬂat space which\noccur, for instance, at some ﬁxed string coupling, with the energies and the size of the\ninteraction region kept ﬁxed in string (or Planck) units. Computations on AdS space\nare necessarily done with some ﬁnite radius of curvature; however, we can view this\nradius of curvature as a regulator, and take it to inﬁnity at the end of any calculation,\nin such a way that the local physics remains the same. Let us discuss what this means\nfor the AdS5 × S5 case (the discussion is similar for other cases). We need to keep the\nstring coupling ﬁxed, and take N →∞since the radius of curvature in Planck units is\nproportional to N1/4. Note that this is diﬀerent from the ’t Hooft limit, and involves\ntaking λ →∞. In order to describe a scattering process in space-time which has ﬁnite\nenergies in this limit, it turns out that the energies in the ﬁeld theory must scale as\nN1/4 (measured in units of the scale of the S3 which the ﬁeld theory is compactiﬁed\non; we need to work in global AdS coordinates to describe ﬂat-space scattering). In\nthis limit the ﬁeld theory is very strongly coupled and the energies are also very high,\nand there are no known ways to do any computations on the ﬁeld theory side.\nIt\nwould be interesting to compute anything explicitly in this limit.\nFor example, it\nwould be interesting to compute the entropy of a small Schwarzschild black hole, much\nsmaller than the radius of AdS, to see ﬂat-space Hawking radiation, and so on. If we\nstart with AdS5 × S5 this limit gives us the physics in ﬂat ten dimensional space, and\nsimilarly starting with AdS4 × S7 or AdS7 × S4 we can get the physics in ﬂat eleven\ndimensional space. It would be interesting to understand how the correspondence can\nbe used to learn about theories with lower dimension, where some of the dimensions\nare compactiﬁed. A limit of string theory on AdS3 × S3 × M4 may be used to give\nstring theory on R5,1 × M4, but it is not clear how to get four dimensional physics out\nof the correspondence.\nOne could, in principle, get four dimensional ﬂat space by starting from AdS2 × S2\ncompactiﬁcations.\nHowever, the correspondence in the case of AdS2 spaces is not\nwell understood. AdS2 spaces arise as the near horizon geometry of extremal charged\nReissner-Nordstrom black holes. Even though ﬁelds propagating in AdS2 behave sim-\nilarly to the higher dimensional cases [739], the problem is that any ﬁnite energy\nexcitation seems to destroy the AdS2 boundary conditions [342]. This is related to\nthe fact that black holes (as opposed to black p-branes, p > 0) have an energy gap\n(see section 5.7), so that in the extreme low energy limit we seem to have no exci-\ntations. One possibility is that the correspondence works only for the ground states.\nEven then, there are instantons that can lead to a fragmentation of the spacetime into\nseveral pieces [740]. Some conformal quantum mechanics systems that are, or could\nbe, related to AdS2 were studied in [741, 742, 743, 729]. Aspects of Hawking radiation\nin AdS2 were studied in [744].\n226\n"}

It would be interesting to understand how the correspondence works when\nthe boundary is light-like, as in Minkowski space. It seems that holography must work\nquite diﬀerently in these cases (see [745, 746] for discussions of some of the issues in-\nvolved). In the cases we understand, the asymptotic space close to the boundary has\na well deﬁned notion of time, which is the one that is associated to the gauge the-\nory. It would be interesting to understand how holography works in other spacetimes,\nwhere we do not have this notion of time. Interesting examples are spatially closed\nuniverses, expanding universes, de-Sitter spacetimes, etc. See [747, 748, 749, 750] for\nsome attempts in this direction. The precise meaning of holography in the cosmological\ncontext is still not clear [751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, 757].\nTo summarize, the past 18 months have seen much progress in our understanding of\nstring/M theory compactiﬁcations on AdS and related spaces, and in our understand-\ning of large N ﬁeld theories. However, the correspondence is still far from realizing the\nhopes that it initially raised, and much work still remains to be done. The correspon-\ndence gives us implicit ways to describe QCD and related interesting ﬁeld theories in\na dual “stringy” description, but so far we are unable to do any explicit computations\nin the ﬁeld theories that we are really interested in. The main hope for progress in\nthis direction lies in a better understanding of string theory in RR backgrounds. The\ncorrespondence also gives us an explicit example of a unitary and holographic theory\nof quantum gravity. We hope this example can be used to better understand quan-\ntum gravity in ﬂat space, where the issues of unitarity (the “information problem”)\nand holography are still quite obscure. Even better, one could hope that the corre-\nspondence would hint at a way to formulate string/M theory independently of the\nbackground.
